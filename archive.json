The PQ/T algorithms should therefore encrypt the session key + checksum as well and it should be made explicit to the reader. I realize that the key wrap itself already has an integrity check but there is no harm in including the checksum bytes. Otherwise we explicitly have to deviate from the standard PKESK format which introduces an unnecessary special case.\r\n\r\nThen, the additional problem of AES Key Wrap (RFC3394) only accepting data with length of multiples of 8 bytes arises: With the checksum, the key has improper length. The crypto refresh already uses pkcs5/pkcs7 padding for ECDH (Section 12.5).\r\nWe can do the same or use another method, e.g., there exists RFC5649 which extends the AES Key Wrap with padding.\r\nEven if it is decided to only wrap the session key without a checksum, we should include some form of padding. This reduces the risk of future incompatibilities if (for whatever reasons) there are symmetric algorithms with key sizes that are not multiples of 64 bit.\r\n\r\nRelevant lines in the Crypto Refresh for the ECDH encryption (Section 12.5):\r\n```\r\nm = symm_alg_ID || session key || checksum || pkcs5_padding;\r\n```\r\n```\r\nCompute C = AESKeyWrap( Z, m ) as per [[RFC3394](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc3394)]\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

If we go with RFC5649 it's the same as RFC3394 AES Key Wrap for keys that are multiples of 8 (i.e., no padding is applied). That means, implementers can simply ignore the padding part (for now) if MR!223 goes through. I'm not insisting on padding, but it'd make the construction more robust against protocol changes or new ciphers with \"strange\" key sizes at no additional cost.",

From a provable security point of view we could omit the hash in hashed-DH as the output anyway gets fed to a KDF in the key combiner. What we would have to show is that the resulting KEM is still secure whenever just one of the input KEMs is still secure. Let's consider the case where ECDH is still secure. In that case, the key-share and ciphertext (as well as potentially the receiver key-share a.k.a pk in the KEM) get fed to a KDF with some additional, public, but potentially adversary controlled inputs. I.e., the hash is happening and in the ROM it is straight-forward to argue that the additional input does not hurt security. A similar, but simpler argument works in the Kyber case.\r\n\r\nHowever, from a computational point of view, we are not gaining much. OpenPGP is not deployed in settings where a single hash will make a massive difference in terms of cost or energy (in contrast to Kyber in general -- see the pqc-forum discussion about the PRNG-hash in Kyber). At the same time, I think there is a second dimension to be considered. In optimizing away the hash, we build something that breaks down when people reuse parts of it. E.g., if people decide to implement \"the DH-KEM as in openPGP\" without reading the security considerations in detail, option a) will leave them with an only passively secure (== insecure in general applications) KEM. Similarly, if at a later point someone decides to change the KEM combiner and the new one does not include a ciphertext hash as it works somehow differently... the result is insecure. \r\n\r\nGiven that we describe the setup in a somewhat modular way, I consider it dangerous to base security on the monolithic construct. Hence, I suggest to not do a) but do b).         ",

          "body": "Here once more my conclusion regarding multi-user security:\r\n\r\nSetup: We have two KEMs which we assume to be multi-user secure. We combine their outputs using a KEM-combiner k = H(k1, c1, k2, c2), c = (c1, c2).\r\n\r\nQuestion 1: Do we have to add pk1 and pk2 to H to preserve multi-user security?\r\n\r\nAnswer: No. To break security the adversary has to distinguish a set of challenge keys k*_u from random (one per user / pk). For each of these k* it holds that if the adversary never makes a query H(k1*_u, c1*_u, k2*_u, c2*_u) they have a zero advantage over guessing [the result of the query is k*_u if it was not random and something different from k*_u if it was random -- without querying a random oracle H at a position x an adversary cannot make any statement about H(x)].\r\n\r\nThe only multi-user advantage that the adversary could gain therefore consists of queries to H that are meaningful for two different users u1 != u2 and their associated public keys. This is only the case if (c1*_u1, c2*_u1) = (c1*_u2, c2*_u2) as the ciphertext values decide for which challenge the query is meaningful. I.e., we need a ciphertext collision between challenges. We will argue that this is sufficiently unlikely. \r\n\r\nNote, that up to decryption errors, encapsulation is an injective function (otherwise you could not decapsulate). That means that the actual image of the (partial) encapsulation function in the ciphertext space C is at least as large as the space of shared secrets K which in turn has to have sufficient size such that the min-entropy of the challenge k* is linear in the security parameter (in practice it will be 256bit and therefore |K| >= 2^256). Now, even if (worst case ever) two users have the same public key, the probability that the challenge ciphertexts are identical is at most 2^-min_entropy (this makes the assumption that the randomness used in the generation of the two challenges is uncorrelated; if it is not independent this is not guaranteed). Hence, the probability that any two users have the same challenge ciphertext is |U^2| * 2^-min_entropy.\r\n\r\nIn consequence, the ciphertexts already work sufficiently well as domain-separator. \r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion 2: Can adding pk1 and pk2 to H add multi-user security if the KEMs themselve are not multi-user secure (beyond the trivial non-tight bound)?\r\n\r\nAnswer: Unlikely, we were unable to construct a counter-example in a short time period, but previous works were only able to show that using a key-ID to domain-separate all hashes preserves multi-user security (see, e.g. https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1351.pdf).   \r\n\r\n\r\nIn consequence, it seems as if it does not make sense to add the pk.",

And for the latter, indeed, there can be a problem, as I learned from my implementation of KMAC in Botan. KMAC  [makes use of KECCAK[c]](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/specialpublications/nist.sp.800-185.pdf#page=28), a hash-function building block from which also SHA-3 is derived, that is most likely not readily available in most libraries. It wasn't in Botan, and I had to dig into the SHA-3 details and refactor some code to make KECCAK[c] available. This lead to a longer discussion of how the new design of the KECCAK[c]-based hash functions should look with the Botan maintainers. See \r\n\r\n* https://github.com/randombit/botan/issues/3279\r\n* and https://github.com/randombit/botan/pull/3525.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the need for refactoring is the following: Formally, SHA-3 is derived from KECCAK[c] as specified [here](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.202.pdf#page=28). For instance:\r\n```\r\nSHA3-224(M) = KECCAK[448] (M || 01, 224)\r\n```\r\nHere, `01` denotes the final padding bits of SHA3. KMAC uses a different final bit padding. Now there is also a [final bit padding already in KECCAK[c]](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.202.pdf#page=27), which is applied prior to that of the derived hash function. However, in Botan, these final bit paddings were mixed together, which made it difficult to understand what is happing in the code exactly and required me not only to use the KMAC specification, but also to disentangle the SHA-3 implementation from its basic building block KECCAK[c].\r\n\r\nI haven't looked into any other crypto libraries, but I would assume that at least some will have the same problem. So my conclusion is that an HMAC-based approach might indeed be simpler, even though it will require some overhead in coding the dual-PRF. But at least that will be straightforward and not require an analysis or refactoring of the underlying algorithms, as I experienced with Botan.",

I agree it's extra work to get KMAC right, but it does provide some practical advantages over both SHA2 and SHA3. \r\n\r\nSHA2, as Falko has said has the issue of not being a dual-PRF or anywhere close to a split-key pseudorandom functions (as required for the formal proof in the [paper Falko linked](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/065.pdf)).\r\n\r\nThen, I personally think KMAC is still superior to SHA-3:\r\n- It requires the same primitives to be available, therefore it does not really expand the implementation footprint\r\n- It provides domain separation. SHA-3 can be used to perform KDF in the ECDH packet too. That packet's fucked up because it tries to be NIST SP 800 56C compliant but  includes a variable length left-encoded OID that messes up the right-encoded values (i.e. fixed positions counting from the right). Algorithm ID and version are in the limbo of the variable-length part.\r\n- SHA3 (especially in its 512 bit variant, to provide the same bit-level security as KMAC256) is slower than KMAC\r\n- As implemented in the PR, SHA3 limits the key size to its output size, i.e. using SHA3-256 effectively bars out using anything higher than 256 bit keys (not that I'm greatly concerned about using 512 bit keys, but to be kept in mind)\r\n- KMAC provides an independent output based on the requested oBits length, while SHA-3 just truncates the output. This could be achieved from SHA-3 too, but needs some readapting.\r\n\r\nI don't think that any implementation supporting SHA3 can't support KMAC. It might be tricky to have access to the primitives, as Falko mentioned.\r\n\r\nAs an author of [draft-ounsworth-cfrg-kem-combiners](https://github.com/EntrustCorporation/draft-ounsworth-cfrg-kem-combiners) I gotta add that we considered dropping the SHA3 variants and leave KMAC only, because of the previous reasons and the feedback we got from the CFRG. We decided to leave it in there because there could be some really constrained protocol that might have a good use of it and it's indeed not insecure, but just offers less. OpenPGP is IMO definitely not a constrained protocol.\r\n\r\nFinally Nettle offers [shake256 with context](https://docs.rs/nettle-sys/latest/nettle_sys/fn.nettle_sha3_256_shake.html), and rust offers [sha3::CShake256Core](https://docs.rs/sha3/latest/sha3/struct.CShake256Core.html) upon which KMAC can be built as [we did in golang](https://github.com/ProtonMail/go-crypto/blob/3d33cfd85858654533d5ab2728c4048dadccc87b/internal/kmac/kmac.go). OpenSSL seems indeed not to offer the bindings, and I hope to be wrong, but seems like CNG [does not even offer SHA3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccng/cng-algorithm-identifiers).\r\n\r\nNote that this is still a draft, and am happy to hear feedback from developers. If the community thinks the advantages of KMAC does not counterbalance the costs of implementing it I'm still happy to switch to the SHA3-256 variant, but not as done in #48, as I think some parts are missing there. In particular I'd include the counter increase and improve the context separation definition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Today it may be convincing that the traditional scheme plays only a transitory role. But actually an application with long term security requirements that has to use the composite at the point where the new standard is available, it is necessary to fulfill that requirement in both scenarios where either of the two schemes turns out to be insecure.\r\n\r\nFrom that perspective I see it as natural to pair schemes in composite constructions only with equal classical security. Especially for encryption this is ultimately important in my opinion, but also applies to signatures.\r\n\r\nI am aware that the the current selection of pairs is aligned with the choices of LAMPS. However, from my perspective it would make sense to point them to this issue as well.",

And, I can actually imagine a use case for reusing existing ECC key material: Imagine I have a smart card that holds my ECC keys for my existing v6 cert, and I want to create a PQ cert in addition to that.  Reusing the ECC key material seems convenient and adds security over having the ECC keys being softkeys, as in the mid term there won't be PQ-capable smart cards.

Our concern here is that these notions are taken rather seriously with respect to CMS signatures. Just now at IETF 118 this aspect was discussed for the LAMPS composite signatures draft. In order to reach the strongest non-separability notion given in the [signature specturms draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-hale-pquip-hybrid-signature-spectrums/), forbidding key reuse is the only realistic way. I think OpenPGP already achieves the weaker notion, since the signature algorithm ID is part of the hashed data (I couldn't find that in the crypto-refresh, wold be nice if someone could confirm or refute this). Thus, when stripping one of the component signatures of a component scheme, the hash value that is signed wouldn't fit to the message any more.\r\n\r\nIn any case your concern is valid in my opinion. From my point of view this decision would be something for the WG to vote on after they understand the two approaches and advantages and disadvantages.\r\n",

In this case, the symmetric algorithm used MUST be AES-128, AES-192 or AES-256 (algorithm ID 7, 8 or 9).\r\n\r\nBut this isn't possible with RFC 4880 to which we aim to be compatible here, as there AES-128 is only a SHOULD. The only MUST symmetric algorithm there is TripleDES. So either we require at the same time with introducing PQC that AES-128 becomes a MUST, which seems a bit strange to me, or we have to keep the symmetric algorithm flexible, which would make the most sense in my opinion.\r\n\r\nFrom a practical perspective requiring AES-128 as MUST is most likely realistic. But from a formal perspective it means that a sending client conforming to RFC 4880 and sending an encrypted mail to multiple recipients, some supporting ML-KEM, some not, could come into the conflict of having to use AES-128 for the PQC supporting recipients and TripleDES for the legacy clients. Actually the similar but even bigger problem can happen to a client supporting the crypto-refresh and sending to mutiple clients, since the crypto-refresh even completely forbids TripleDES.\r\n\r\nSo should we simply assume that clients today all support AES-128?\r\n\r\n@TJ-91 @wussler @fluppe2\r\n\r\n\r\n",

We do use AES Key Wrap as part of the PKESK packets (for X2559/X448/PQC keys), which are per-recipient. We choose the symmetric algorithm based on the principle of \"least common denominator\" and it is per-message, meaning, everyone gets the same message with the same encryption algorithm/key.\r\n\r\nAlso, are we still talking about the backwards compatible issue to legacy (RFC4880) certificates or about generally restricting the algorithm to AES for PQC? If the former, it does not make any sense to me to mandate AES-256 when we aim for compatibility. Remember: This affects all recipients, also the ones that do not have new algorithms and use AES256-KW anyway. If the latter, this is a much more severe change that we have to discuss separately.\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind that the choice of the symmetric algorithm is orthogonal to the choice of the public-key encryption algorithm. Even requiring AES-128/192/256 for the PKESKv3 case as we (and the Crypto Refresh) currently do is not really \"natural\" for the protocol. Or am I severely misunderstanding something?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSecond, I want to add a new perspective (but no new information) on the TripleDES issue.\r\n\r\nIn principle, the \"Preferred Symmetric Algorithms\" have to be honored. There is a mismatch between version standards. The mandatory-to-implement algorithm (TripleDES or AES-128) assures that implementations conforming to the spec will always find an intersection of all recipients' preferences (the mandatory-to-implement algorithm). But this is not the case when interoperating between the two standards.\r\n\r\nThe Crypto Refresh defaults to AES-128 when no other algorithm can be found in the intersection. It acknowledges the fact that old implementations might be TripleDES-only implementations but does not loosen the prohibition of using TripleDES and still mandates AES-128 (see 12.2. Symmetric Algorithm Preferences). Therefore, the Crypto Refresh overrides the mandatory-to-implement algorithm to be AES-128 and implicitly assumes that even recipients with old implementations implement it.\r\n\r\nIn summary I think:\r\nIt's not up to the PQC draft to decide what to do here, since it already follows from the Crypto Refresh. Technically, there is no need to clarify any further but I'd not be opposed to a clarification. The right place for a clarification would be in the Crypto Refresh, however.",

I'll note that another aspect of this draft also \"violates\" a traditional OpenPGP separation: the `SLH-DSA` signatures are obliged to use specific choices of digest algorithm for the message. Traditionally, OpenPGP messages could select any digest algorithm with any asymmetric signature primitive.  This isn't exactly the same thing as binding the symmetric cipher to the PKESK choice, of course (for one thing, if you can't read signature A you might still be able to read signature B), but \"violating a traditional separation\" as a general practice isn't necessarily a bad thing.\r\n\r\nAnyway, i don't see why it would be an objection here, especially given that everyone, everywhere, that has any chance of reading a recent encrypted message appears to support both AES-128 and AES-256.",

We bind the symmetric algorithm identifier to AES, and assume that any implementation supports at least `AES-128` (already `MUST` in the Crypto Refresh). The AES restriction makes sure that no cross-algorithm attacks are possible.\r\n2. The second topic in this thread is that we also want to promote the use of `AES-256` since it matches the security of the PQC stuff better than `AES-128` and using `AES-256` is simply good practice and recommended (as Stavros points out). Your proposal to add `AES-256` / `AES-256+OCB` to the preferences of PQC keys does exactly that, but plays no role in the cross-algorithm-attack concerns.\r\n\r\nI hope I got it right since things got a bit confusing.\r\n\r\n> If we want to include it, we should include it by making an explicit\r\n> \"needed for post-quantum\" argument.\r\n\r\nWe can't really say it's \"needed\".

      "body": "I suggest to add sntrup761 and mceliece6688128 to the document.\r\n\r\nIncluding some rationale also posted to the mailing list:\r\n\r\nThe argument would be that sntrup761 is a reasonable alternative for lattice-based kyber, and mceliece is a conservative fallback if lattices fails.\r\n\r\nI believe that for some deployments, the currently chosen algorithms won't be relevant, in the same way that NIST would consider some algorithms not relevant for their deployment.  Fortunately NIST reconsider, so we now have Curve25519 in NIST too, and having others lead the way may have helped that happen.\r\n\r\nPlenty of arguments can be made comparing any two crypto algorithms. While it is easy today to see what went wrong in the design of MD4, RC4, DES; I don't believe we yet can easily tell what the bad parts of current PQ algorithms are (except for the recently broken ones, but that doesn't give us enough of patterns to look for) including the mentioned algorithms.  Classic McEliece is the only one with longer track record, but even that has not been widely deployed on the Internet.\r\n\r\nHard coding deployments of protocols to one mandatory crypto algorithm makes the ecosystem vulnerable if a weakness if found in that algorithm. Compare how long it took to migrate from RC4 in TLS.  I believe the modern design approach is to not have crypto negotiation built into protocols but rather roll protocol version to upgrade all protocol semantics, and have one hard coded crypto algorithm and no in-protocol negotiation.  That's not feasible for legacy PGP as far as I can tell.\r\n\r\nThis all leads me to believe that it is better to mandate at least two different PQ-safe algorithms so that we get two variants deployed and get better testing of algorithm negotiation.  The algorithms to select is a subjective choice, and I suggest we pick variants that cater to different communities.\r\n",

We can either clarify that implementations should/must follow the Crypto Refresh's v4 specification, or we can add some broad statements about deprecated hash and symmetric encryption algorithms.

It's already too ambiguous.  please don't make\nit more ambiguous.\n\n> Is v4 + PQC \"modern\"?\n\nIf by \"v4 + PQC\" you mean \"following only the guidance in RFC 4880, but\nwith a post-quantum algorithm\", this combination on its face is not\nmodern.  v4 was defined in RFC 4880 in 2007, over 16 years ago.

It's\n2024, and there is absolutely no reason to accommodate an implementation\nthat is capable of understanding ML-KEM, ML-DSA, or SLH-DSA, but still\ndecides to publish and rely on SHA-1 for its signatures.\n\n> So, we can add all sorts of statements that the Crypto Refresh already\n> makes but I think this will bloat the PQC spec.\n\nI don't think it's much of a bloat to say something simple like:\n\n    Subkey binding signatures over algorithms described in this document\n    and primary key binding signatures made by algorithms described in\n    this document MUST NOT be made with `MD5`, `SHA-1`, or `RIPEMD-160`.\n    A receiving implementation MUST be treated such a signature as\n    invalid.\n",

I think the most constructive way forward would be to look at the differences between the Crypto Refresh and RFC 4880 (+Camellia/ECC) and solely concentrate on v4. Then we can see if we need all of it, or only some of it.\r\n\r\nJust a note: this all only affects v4 certificates with a PQ/T encryption subkey. PQ(/T) signatures are only allowed for v6 currently.\r\n\r\nWhen skimming through https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-openpgp-crypto-refresh-13#name-upgrade-guidance-adapting-i I think nothing really hurts too much for an implementation willing to implement PQC.\r\n\r\n* avoiding RSA weak keys / DSA / ElGamal is a good step that you want to take when you upgrade to PQC.\r\n* implementing X25519/Ed25519 as MTI seems easy enough if you implement the PQC MTI algorithms (that also require X25519/Ed25519 and AES KeyWrap). Edit: Is this really MTI for v4? Seems strange.\r\n* avoiding the deprecated digest and symmetric encryption algorithms is also reasonable.\r\n* avoiding SED packets seems reasonable.\r\n* avoiding v3 also seems reasonable.\r\n* other stuff about S2K etc. can probably be ignored if an implementation wishes to. I do not see how it relates to PQC at all. Obviously, it'd be best to follow the new spec, though. \r\n\r\nPlease tell me if I've missed something big. \r\nI see three options:\r\n\r\n1. Mandating to follow the Crypto Refresh's v4 spec.\r\n2. Decide on a \"minimal set of additions to RFC 4880(+Camellia/ECC)\" that we deem necessary for PQC.\r\n3. Make no restrictions at all and just let implementations add a new public-key algorithm.\r\n\r\nI think 1) is the easiest solution but would be willing to go with 2) if we see a clear reason that this could speed up the adoption of PQC encryption. I don't really see it, though. As for option 3) I guess we have ruled that out already.",

As long as any other version of the KDF that introduces a new `domSep` value ensures that the encoding of different values is suffix-free (i.e., the new version does not end with `\"OpenPGPCompositeKDFv1\"`)\r\n\r\n> But that mechanism seems a bit brittle (one would have to properly parse the encoded string from the rear). I would prefer to have an explicit length encoding. \r\n\r\nI agree with the length encoding for `domSep`. Using `domSep || len(domSep) || algID` is safe in my estimation, as long as a new KDF version does not change this structure at the end of the SHA3 input string and only changes the value of `domSep`. This means the new proposal is a bit more robust against unfortunate choices of future `domSep` values (however, the designer of the new KDF version would not likely choose a string that ends with `\"OpenPGPCompositeKDFv1\"`)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOne point that I just now thought of is the remote possibility of adding multi-byte algorithm identifiers (which was discussed as a possibility on several occasions). In that case the inputs can collide if the algorithm identifier comes last. Thus, it might be better to put `domSep || len(domSep)` last and then the new algorithms can unambiguously be used with a new KDF version. Or add a length byte for the algorithm identifier.",

I don't think there can be any drawback, as the ECDH public key and ciphertext are still input as part of `<other input>` above.\r\n\r\nThe alternative that Quynh pointed out is to keep using KMAC. The formal difference seems to stem from the fact that in [NIST.SP.800-108r1](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-108r1-upd1.pdf#page=10) it says that the input keys may stem from  \"[...] or a previous instance of key derivation as specified in this Recommendation\" (p. 2) and thus allows to use KMAC with `hash(Z || ...) || T` as the input. That this does not equally apply to SHA3 is simply due to SP.800-108r1 not specifying SHA3 as a KDF at all.\r\n",

But since X25519/X448 is considered by NIST to receive NIST compliance as well, it has a certain relevance to the main draft as well.\n\nThe solution would be omitting the hashing step from the ECDH specification. Then we input the raw shared secret from the ECDH scheme into the key combiner as required by NIST. I don't think there can be any drawback, as the ECDH public key and ciphertext are still input as part of <other input> above.\n\nThe alternative that Quynh pointed out is to keep using KMAC. The formal difference seems to stem from the fact that in NIST.SP.800-108r1<https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-108r1-upd1.pdf#page=10> it says that the input keys may stem from \"[...] or a previous instance of key derivation as specified in this Recommendation\" (p. 2) and thus allows to use KMAC with hash(Z || ...) || T as the input. That this does not equally apply to SHA3 is simply due to SP.800-108r1 not specifying SHA3 as a KDF at all.\n\n[Dang, Quynh H. (Fed)] perfect recap! KMAC with hash(Z || ...) || T being the Key Derivation Key in 108.\n\nRegards,\n\nQuynh.\n\n-\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://github.com/openpgp-pqc/draft-openpgp-pqc/issues/132#issuecomment-2220386567>, or unsubscribe<https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AFTFKRASDNVDHIVN7Y4LWTDZLUSFZAVCNFSM6AAAAABKUTZYRKVHI2DSMVQWIX3LMV43OSLTON2WKQ3PNVWWK3TUHMZDEMRQGM4DMNJWG4>.\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.Message ID: ***@***.***>\n",

This is something that we will most likely only know once NIST's recommendations for PQ/T hybrid is specified. The other solution, namely switching back to KMAC does not have this problem, since with KMAC we receive a generic KDF according to NIST.SP.800-108r1. Thus in this case there is no limitation on where the input secrets to the KMAC-based KDF stem from.\r\n",

          "body": "Dear all, Falko asked me to provide a comment on this.\r\n\r\nI would like to highlight two aspects here. First, our goal is to build a \"KEM-combiner\", i.e., something that constructs a secure KEM from two KEMs. The initial hash of the ECDH data achieves exactly this: It turns DH into a KEM. This way, we are able to apply modular reasoning which also protects against issues stemming from replacing ECDH by some other construction. \r\n\r\nSecond, our set goal is really to construct an IND-CCA secure KEM. This is a mismatch with https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-56Ar3.pdf  which describes how to derive a secret key from some source of computational entropy (like a pre-master secret) where one such source is obtained via DH. Note that while the SP this does not explicitly state any security goals (at least I did not find any), the way it is written suggests that active security is not a concern here. \r\n\r\nRegarding what we know in terms of results: We have a security proof for a KEM that is obtained by combining the data of two KEMs as is currently done in the draft (KDF(k1,c1,pk1,k2,c2,pk2) where the order does not matter if we use SHA3/SHAKE/KMAC-SHA3). This proof is in the standard model and thereby holds against quantum adversaries as well. I do not know what we can prove for the \"simply hashing everything in the end\" approach (KDF(DH.k, k2, DH.pk_sender, DH.pk_receiver, c2, pk2)). This will require a direct, non-modular proof for the full construction. Does NIST have any results for this? I did not see references in the SP.\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\n\r\nAndreas\r\n  ",

The security considerations as they are proposed in this PR are tailored to such a modular approach.\r\n- The hashing in the ECC-KEMs ensures CCA2-security, the hashing is necessary if you want to achieve CCA2-security for the ECC-KEM itself. Only concatenation is not enough for this purpose as an attacker would control changes to the concatenation bitwise, the hashing ensures that changes propagate. Just to be clear, here I am looking only on the ECC-KEM itself.\r\n- Having the hashing step in the ECC-KEMs, I think it is enough to simply input the K1 || C1 || K2 || C2 into the combiner as the lengths of all key shares and ciphertexts are constant depending only on the specific parameters of the ingredient KEMs. We do not have to introduce an additional H(K1||C1) || H(K2||C2) in the combiner.\r\n- If we decide to remove the hashing step in the ECC-KEMs we would have to adopt our security considerations, trying to argue that the combined construction as a whole is (maybe) CCA2-secure, then I would rather suggest to have the KEM combiner processing H(K1||C1) || H(K2||C2), since assuming that K1, C1 come from an ECC-KEM, the hashing step for ECC-KEM would then be performed inside the combiner. Maybe that would allow a security argument that while the ECC-KEM building blocks are only IND-CPA, the construction as a whole would (maybe) ensure IND-CCA2. I don't know. Assuming for the moment that K2, C2 come from Kyber then the additional hashing might be superfluous but relieves an implementer from length checks so might be beneficial.\r\n\r\nJust trying to do state-of-the-art crypto. The modular approach allows for nice and clean security arguments backed up by the present scientific literature. The more tailored approach with IND-CPA versions of ECC-KEMs and (potential) CCA2-security established by the KEM combiner could be a bit more involved.",

Johannes and I had discussed this a bit already. The crucial point is that if we don't allow it, then a sender cannot use PQC encryption for any recipient if there is a single recipient that does not support v6 PKESK. The reason is that v3 PKESK is tied to v1 SEIPD and v6 PKESK is tied to v2 SEIPD. Thus v3 and v6 PKESK cannot be mixed in a single message. This is a point that we previously didn't think through I think. I think we should analyze the potential for cross-protocol attacks. Disallowing v3 PKESK for PQC might lead to a bad user experience, in the worst case that a message cannot be sent encrypted to a given set of recipients. At present I don't think that it is the duty of our draft to restrict the interoperability any more then technically necessary.",

If a library, like Botan, implements SHA-3 and SHAKE this is still not enough to implement KMAC. In such cases the Keccak[c] function has to be made available, which forces the developer to deal with its internals to some degree since the final bit padding for cSHAKE differs from that of SHAKE:\r\n\r\n`SHAKE128(M, d) = KECCAK[256] (M || 1111, d)`\r\n\r\n`cSHAKE128(...) = KECCAK[256](... || X || 00, L)`\r\n\r\nThis is what I experienced with Botan.",

We should not forget that if we find hard to implement this in the first two implementations, it might be very hard for others too.

We combine their outputs using a KEM-combiner k = H(k1, c1, k2, c2), c = (c1, c2).\r\n\r\nQuestion 1: Do we have to add pk1 and pk2 to H to preserve multi-user security?\r\n\r\nAnswer: No. To break security the adversary has to distinguish a set of challenge keys k*_u from random (one per user / pk). For each of these k* it holds that if the adversary never makes a query H(k1*_u, c1*_u, k2*_u, c2*_u) they have a zero advantage over guessing [the result of the query is k*_u if it was not random and something different from k*_u if it was random -- without querying a random oracle H at a position x an adversary cannot make any statement about H(x)].\r\n\r\nThe only multi-user advantage that the adversary could gain therefore consists of queries to H that are meaningful for two different users u1 != u2 and their associated public keys. This is only the case if (c1*_u1, c2*_u1) = (c1*_u2, c2*_u2) as the ciphertext values decide for which challenge the query is meaningful. I.e., we need a ciphertext collision between challenges. We will argue that this is sufficiently unlikely. \r\n\r\nNote, that up to decryption errors, encapsulation is an injective function (otherwise you could not decapsulate). That means that the actual image of the (partial) encapsulation function in the ciphertext space C is at least as large as the space of shared secrets K which in turn has to have sufficient size such that the min-entropy of the challenge k* is linear in the security parameter (in practice it will be 256bit and therefore |K| >= 2^256). Now, even if (worst case ever) two users have the same public key, the probability that the challenge ciphertexts are identical is at most 2^-min_entropy (this makes the assumption that the randomness used in the generation of the two challenges is uncorrelated; if it is not independent this is not guaranteed). Hence, the probability that any two users have the same challenge ciphertext is |U^2| * 2^-min_entropy.\r\n\r\nIn consequence, the ciphertexts already work sufficiently well as domain-separator. \r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion 2: Can adding pk1 and pk2 to H add multi-user security if the KEMs themselve are not multi-user secure (beyond the trivial non-tight bound)?\r\n\r\nAnswer: Unlikely, we were unable to construct a counter-example in a short time period, but previous works were only able to show that using a key-ID to domain-separate all hashes preserves multi-user security (see, e.g. https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1351.pdf).   \r\n\r\n\r\nIn consequence, it seems as if it does not make sense to add the pk.",

No need to hurry.\r\n\r\n### The point you to some specifics changes that might be difficult to spot due to the amount of change marks:\r\n\r\n- Felt the need to align eccKem.encap()/decap() to the ML-KEM terminology, i.e. switched to ECC-KEM.Encaps()/Decaps() (likewise x25519.Encaps() etc.)\r\n\r\n- In Table 9 I spotted some typos (I think). The last colum was \u201eECDH-KEM curve\u201c, I think it should be consistently \u201eECC-KEM curve\u201c. In this last column there was X25519, X448 which should be Curve25519 and Curve448.\r\n\r\n- In Section 5.1.1 and 5.2.4 it was:\r\n  - \"The placeholder `eccKem` has to be replaced with the specific ECC-KEM from the row \"ECC-KEM\" of [Table 5],  [Table 6], or [Table 7].\"\r\n  - \"The placeholder `kyberKem` has to be replaced with the specific Kyber-KEM from the column \"Kyber-KEM\" of [Table 8].\"\r\n\r\n  I now borrowed the sentence from the NIST draft standards:\r\n\r\n  - \"To instantiate ECC-KEM, one must select a parameter set from [Table 5],  [Table 6], or [Table 7].\"\r\n  - \"To instantiate ML-KEM, one must select a parameter set from the column \"ML-KEM\" of [Table 8]\"\r\n\r\n- In Section 5.2.4 and 5.2.5 it was:\r\n\r\n  - \"Instantiate the ECC-KEM eccKem.encap() and the ML-KEM ML-KEM.Encaps() depending on the algorithm ID according to [Table 9]\"\r\n  - \"Instantiate the ECC-KEM eccKem.decap() and the ML-KEM ML-KEM.Decaps() depending on the algorithm ID according to [Table 9]\"\r\n\r\n  Felt it somehow doubled to write \u201einstantiate ECC-KEM eccKem.encap()\u201c. I understand that it is meant to establish the mindset \u201ehere you need encaps/decaps\u201c. But I don\u2019t know what it means to instantiate an algorithm and felt it better to write\r\n\r\n  - \u201eInstantiate the ECC-KEM and the ML-KEM depending on the algorithm ID according to [Table 9](https://github.com/openpgp-pqc/draft-openpgp-pqc/Repositories/draft-openpgp-pqc/draft-wussler-openpgp-pqc.html#tab-mlkem-ecc-composite)\u201c\r\n\r\n  The next lines in the procedures then say whether to Encaps or Decaps anyway.\r\n\r\n- \"Binding hashes\" for ML-DSA and SLH-DSA: I switched the section title to \"Signature Data Digest\" to be clearer what we mean. Please take a look at the specific sections if this is ok for you as I wrote it.\r\n\r\n### Some specific issues that I spotted and not touched but would like to pose them for discussion:\r\n\r\n- Is it clear how to encode secret and public key material and ciphertexts/signatures from pointing the reader to the FIPS documents and saying fixed-length octet strings? Or should we list the contents of the specific octet strings or maybe point to the data in the FIPS documents?\r\n\r\n- Section 6.2.1 states SHA3-256 as MUST and SHA3-512 as SHOULD, but if one implements ML-DSA-87 then the requirement on SHA3-512 turns into MUST. IS that clear from our formulation?",

I understand that it is meant to establish the mindset \u201ehere you need encaps/decaps\u201c. But I don\u2019t know what it means to instantiate an algorithm and felt it better to write\r\n>       \r\n>       * \u201eInstantiate the ECC-KEM and the ML-KEM depending on the algorithm ID according to [Table 9](https://github.com/openpgp-pqc/draft-openpgp-pqc/Repositories/draft-openpgp-pqc/draft-wussler-openpgp-pqc.html#tab-mlkem-ecc-composite)\u201c\r\n\r\nI think the instantiation thing is a leftover from the initial way of describing it in terms of object oriented programming (where eccKem is the abstract base class and you have to choose a concrete instantiation that implements the methods).\r\nWe probably have to wait for external feedback to see whether or not it's currently easy to understand.\r\n\r\n\r\n>     * Is it clear how to encode secret and public key material and ciphertexts/signatures from pointing the reader to the FIPS documents and saying fixed-length octet strings? Or should we list the contents of the specific octet strings or maybe point to the data in the FIPS documents?\r\n\r\nI think it makes sense to point to the exact location in the spec. Listing / repeating the contents in an \"RFC-friendly\" way might be too much overhead with questionable benefit.\r\nWe have more or less two kinds of implementers to consider, I think: 1) someone who integrates an existing implementation and doesn't know or care about the details. They hopefully get the keys/ciphertexts/signatures in the NIST-specified format. 2) implementers who implement the algorithms themselves, they need to deep-dive into the spec anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\n>     * Section 6.2.1 states SHA3-256 as MUST and SHA3-512 as SHOULD, but if one implements ML-DSA-87 then the requirement on SHA3-512 turns into MUST. IS that clear from our formulation?\r\n\r\nFor me it's clear but I see what you mean. Perhaps it makes sense to replace the text by a list that binds each algorithm ID to a hash algorithm, analogous to the SLH-DSA parameters (Table 14).\r\nWe can also address #57 there (i.e., SHA3-512 is always allowed when SHA3-256 is allowed).\r\n\r\nWe should make separate issues/PRs for individual topics that don't directly relate to the changes to align to the NIST draft.",

Furthermore, we want to point out that, depending on possible\r\nfuture changes to the draft standards by NIST, this specification may be updated\r\nas soon as corresponding information becomes available.\\]\r\n```\r\nMaybe we should indicate that we are referring to NIST **Drafts** also in the references by prefixing of postfixing the title either with \"FIPS 203 (Initial Public Draft)\" etc. as it is on the NIST web page of \"FIPS 203 (Draft)\" as it is in the PDF of the draft.\r\n\r\n@fluppe2 Do you want to include the new version of the note into the PR (possibly after revising it if necessary from your point of view)?

Please let me know when your partial fixes are available and whether I can help you with it.\r\n\r\nPS: Is there a specific reason why you generated PKESKv3/SEIPDv1 rather than the newer versions? I think we should generate two sets for the draft: v6 PQC keys + PKESKv6/SEIPDv2 and v4 PQC keys + PKESKv3/SEIPDv1 (but for now the main thing is to have any test vector that the implementations agree with at all)\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n> When deriving the KEK, the cipher identifier is passed as 000...000 instead of 1d (or similar)\r\n\r\nBtw, this is due to a wrong initialization of a `std::vector` in `KMAC256::fixedInfo()`. To clarify, do you intend to patch the RNP code as well or should I do it?",

The crucial aspect of Cramer-Shoup is the inclusion of `eccCipherText`.\r\n- we raised this security aspect during the inclusion of X25519 and X448 in the crypto-refresh and pointed the OpenPGP WG to the security considerations of RFC7748 which states \"Alice and Bob can then use a key-derivation function that includes K, K_A, and K_B to derive a symmetric key.\". The K_A, K_B map to our `eccPublicKey` and `eccCipherText`. It has been applied to the crypto-refresh such that they included both in their KDF.\r\n- we adopted the additional inclusion of `eccPublicKey` in our ECC-KEMs to align to the approach of the crypto-refresh.\r\n\r\nML-KEM doas not need the explicit mentioning of the public key since it does extract the public key from the decapsulation key as @falko-strenzke and @wussler state it, i.e. already incorporates such an IND-CCA2 conversion and accomodates the needed data in the decapsulation key.\r\n\r\nSince the `mlkemSecretKey` contains the actual secret key AND the public key I guess we have two options here:\r\n\r\n1) Do it the way @wussler proposed it here and just have a slightly different interface for the ECC-KEMs.\r\n2) Mimic the way ML-KEM does it and define the ECC public key as part of the ML-KEM+ECC secret key packet in \u00a75.3.2 from which the `eccPublicKey` could then be extracted in the decapsulation function ECC-KEM.Decaps() without having it to specify it in the interface.\r\n\r\nWe are defining the key material packets for new algorithms and hence from scratch anyway so I guess we have the liberty to do this.\r\n\r\nI guess both options are fine. I would (personally) maybe tend to option 2 as I feel it is more in the mindset of modern KEMs to have the public key always be part of the secret key.\r\n\r\nOption 2 will trigger some changes in implementations as it would change the specification of the secret key material packet. In my opinion, we are in such an early stage that this should not hinder us in considering this approach.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think/prefer?\r\n",

With our specification, we followed how the crypto-refresh does it for the v3 PKESK case, in order not to introduce a further variant. Clearly, once one commits to not encrypting the algorithm identifier, the concern of cross-algorithm attacks arises. But what really calls for justification here in my view is why not to encrypt the algorithm identifier in the first place. I think the outset for the justification really has to be: \"There is no need for another symmetric encryption algorithm than AES\". Otherwise this approach is hardly justifiable.",

The only thing that I am a bit concerned about right now is that I anticipate that we will rather prioritise SLH-DSA-SHAKE over -SHA2, and thus the meaning of that code point will change again, potentially causing problems during interop testing if one implementation misses to adopt that change. So maybe we wait a bit with the assignment of any code points for SLH-DSA right now?",

      "body": "Here is my proposal to include `AES-256` as a mandatory-to-implement algorithm and to promote its use as discussed in #74.\r\nI tried to consider all cases and find the best balance between forcing (and migrating to) AES-256 and interoperability with the older specs (RFC4880, Crypto Refresh).\r\n\r\nCases to consider are:\r\n\r\n* Encrypting to a v4 certificate with a PQ/T encryption subkey\r\n* Encrypting to a v4 certificate with only traditional keys\r\n* Encrypting to a v6 certificate with any PQ(/T) key.\r\n* Encrypting to a v6 certificate without any PQ(/T) key.\r\n* Encrypting to certificates that explicitly indicate AES-128 or AES-256 support\r\n* Encrypting to certificates that do not indicate AES-128 or AES-256 support\r\n* Encrypting to any combination of the cases above\r\n\r\nAnother important aspect: If all involved parties use PQ(/T) keys, then AES-256 will be supported (and hopefully favored) by every party. To further push AES-256, I have added the following sentence to the security considerations:\r\n\r\n> An implementation SHOULD use `AES-256` in the case of a v1 SEIPD packet, or `AES-256` and `OCB` in the case of a v2 SEIPD packet, if all recipients indicate support for it (explicitly or implicitly).\r\n\r\nThe reason is that when carelessly implementing the specification, an implementation might otherwise choose to take the simple way of always encrypting via AES-128, even if every recipient uses the \"Level 5\" PQ algorithms. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPlease also comment on:\r\n\r\n* The place where the text is added and the names of the sections\r\n* Is there a better place to state `Implementations MUST implement AES-256`?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf we want to ask for opinions on the mailing list, the argument is: `AES-256` is the obvious choice and this will result in everyone using PQ(/T) + `AES-256` in the long run. We are committed to `AES-256` anyway by the KEM construction.",

I still think a general statement has more weight here and the example is not motivated by a realistic attack scenario. Perhaps you can make it more clear that this is an example of what can happen. To me it currently reads like the continuation of the description of a stripping attack.\r\n\r\n> If the message is known to have not been altered, then no signature verification is needed at all. \r\n\r\nIt is, if you simply store the signed message. You verified it when you received it but you didn't write down \"this was a valid signature at the time of receiving it\". Then you need to re-verify the signature in order to come to the same conclusion now.\r\n\r\n> The signature verification with an untrusted algorithm is worthless in any case.\r\n\r\nThat's not true. For verification you can follow different models and one model is to accept signatures as long as they are valid at the time of creation. As long as you are sure that the signature really has been created at the time and is valid at that time, it will work.\r\n\r\n@wussler yes that would be one example \r\n\r\n@falko-strenzke Anyway it's just a tangential topic and I'm fine if you keep it as it is.",

But to me it still makes, at least per se, no sense to put a length field which says \"this is the length of the next two subsequent fields.

But as I wrote, I also see the argument of aligning with the c-r and will not argue against it.

Adding the public key might be useful as well.\r\n3. Your v6 key doesn't have the SEIPDv2 Feature Flag and I think therefore the encrypted message is a PKESKv3+SEIPDv1 message.

Legacy implementations don't need to encrypt using SEIPDv2, but there is no reason to not advertise it for use by up-to-date implementations.  It should also include a \"Preferred AEAD Ciphersuites\" subpacket.\r\n- the \"compromise key\" should also have an ECDH encryption-capable subkey, presumably using Curve25519Legacy, so that legacy implementations can encrypt to it.

There is no way to interoperate with an implementer who is trying to not interoperate, so there is no point in targeting them.  And the v6 key and sig formats, and v2 SEIPD are now stable, well-specified, and simple to implement compared with anything like ML-KEM.",

Trying to not interoperate is not the same as waiting until everything plays out (see e.g. Kai Engerts views on this).

It could have been left as it is in this PR (the renaming to \"ECDH\" is completely independent of the split, it could have been applied without the split as well).

We should clarify this at least in the PQC specification.\r\n\r\nIn `5.2.3.15. Preferred AEAD Ciphersuites` strictly speaking, it is not described what happens in the absence of the subpacket. The same is true for the non-AEAD stuff (see `12.2. Symmetric Algorithm Preferences`).\r\n\r\nI do think it's not a problem in the Crypto Refresh since it's clear enough what algorithm to choose in such a case since there is only one choice left, the MTI algorithm. Now we extend this mechanism and set more implicit default options to the lists of the subpackets. Now there is ambiguity in the case of a missing subpacket.\r\n\r\nI am also not very happy with the additional text but with the reasoning I gave, do you still think we can drop this clarification completely?",

When viewing both the length, and the KEM input as \"arbitrary length and arbitrary content\" strings, wouldn't we have the same problem even when encoding the length of the algorithm ID? Since we have multiple variable-length fields following each other without a clear boundary. Thus, we need to prefix the length of the other variable input (the KEM data), too.\r\n\r\nAlso, I would change it to simply `0x01` instead of `len(algID)`, since multi-byte IDs are only a remote possibility now.\r\nFurther, I agree with Aron, that we will always have the freedom to adjust the KEM inputs for newly introduced algorithms. The `domSeparation` could then be used to unambigously define the \"version\" of the KDF.",

Since we have multiple variable-length fields following each other without a clear boundary. Thus, we need to prefix the length of the other variable input (the KEM data), too.\r\n\r\nWhat I propose aims exactly at solving this problem. When the string is anambiguously parsable from the rear, collisions cannot happen: after the algorithm ID has been parsed from the rear, the lengths of the other fields are known.\r\n\r\nChanging the domain separation string might again lead to possible collisions. Thus the new  domain separation string would need to be of the same length as the current one. Maybe we should include a two digit (i.e. two byte) version number in the `domSeparation` string and set it to \"00\" for now.",

That solves the problem of the using the word \"recipient\" well in my view. But the use of the word \"anyhow\" doesn't seem right to me. I ran the sentence through deepl and it doesn't translate to German correctly. I think we need to replace \"anyhow\" with \"in some way\" or with \"somehow\".
