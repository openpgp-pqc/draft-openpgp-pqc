                  Post-Quantum Cryptography in OpenPGP
                     draft-ietf-openpgp-pqc-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a post-quantum public-key algorithm extension
   for the OpenPGP protocol.  Given the generally assumed threat of a
   cryptographically relevant quantum computer, this extension provides
   a basis for long-term secure OpenPGP signatures and ciphertexts.
   Specifically, it defines composite public-key encryption based on ML-
   KEM (formerly CRYSTALS-Kyber), composite public-key signatures based
   on ML-DSA (formerly CRYSTALS-Dilithium), both in combination with
   elliptic curve cryptography, and SLH-DSA (formerly SPHINCS+) as a
   standalone public key signature scheme.

1.  Introduction

   The OpenPGP protocol supports various traditional public-key
   algorithms based on the factoring or discrete logarithm problem.  As
   the security of algorithms based on these mathematical problems is
   endangered by the advent of quantum computers, there is a need to
   extend OpenPGP by algorithms that remain secure in the presence of
   quantum computers.

   Such cryptographic algorithms are referred to as post-quantum
   cryptography.  The algorithms defined in this extension were chosen
   for standardization by the National Institute of Standards and
   Technology (NIST) in mid 2022 [NISTIR-8413] as the result of the NIST
   Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization process initiated in 2016
   [NIST-PQC].  Namely, these are ML-KEM [FIPS-203] as a Key
   Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM), a KEM being a modern building block
   for public-key encryption, and ML-DSA [FIPS-204] as well as SLH-DSA
   [FIPS-205] as signature schemes.

   For the two ML-* schemes, this document follows the conservative
   strategy to deploy post-quantum in combination with traditional
   schemes such that the security is retained even if all schemes but
   one in the combination are broken.  In contrast, the stateless hash-
   based signature scheme SLH-DSA is considered to be sufficiently well
   understood with respect to its security assumptions in order to be
   used standalone.  To this end, this document specifies the following
   new set: SLH-DSA standalone and the two ML-* as composite with ECC-
   based KEM and digital signature schemes.  Here, the term "composite"
   indicates that any data structure or algorithm pertaining to the
   combination of the two components appears as single data structure or
   algorithm from the protocol perspective.

   The document specifies the conventions for interoperability between
   compliant OpenPGP implementations that make use of this extension and
   the newly defined algorithms or algorithm combinations.

1.1.  Conventions used in this Document

1.1.1.  Terminology for Multi-Algorithm Schemes

   The terminology in this document is oriented towards the definitions
   in [I-D.ietf-pquip-pqt-hybrid-terminology].  Specifically, the terms
   "multi-algorithm", "composite" and "non-composite" are used in
   correspondence with the definitions therein.  The abbreviation "PQ"
   is used for post-quantum schemes.  To denote the combination of post-
   quantum and traditional schemes, the abbreviation "PQ/T" is used.
   The short form "PQ(/T)" stands for PQ or PQ/T.

1.2.  Post-Quantum Cryptography

   This section describes the individual post-quantum cryptographic
   schemes.  All schemes listed here are believed to provide security in
   the presence of a cryptographically relevant quantum computer.
   However, the mathematical problems on which the two ML-* schemes and
   SLH-DSA are based, are fundamentally different, and accordingly the
   level of trust commonly placed in them as well as their performance
   characteristics vary.

   [Note to the reader: This specification refers to the NIST PQC draft
   standards FIPS 203, FIPS 204, and FIPS 205 as if they were a final
   specification.  This is a temporary solution until the final versions
   of these documents are available.  The goal is to provide a
   sufficiently precise specification of the algorithms already at the
   draft stage of this specification, so that it is possible for
   implementers to create interoperable implementations.  Furthermore,
   we want to point out that, depending on possible future changes to
   the draft standards by NIST, this specification may be updated as
   soon as corresponding information becomes available.]

1.2.1.  ML-KEM

   ML-KEM [FIPS-203] is based on the hardness of solving the Learning
   with Errors problem in module lattices (MLWE).  The scheme is
   believed to provide security against cryptanalytic attacks by
   classical as well as quantum computers.  This specification defines
   ML-KEM only in composite combination with ECDH encryption schemes in
   order to provide a pre-quantum security fallback.

1.2.2.  ML-DSA

   ML-DSA [FIPS-204] is a signature scheme that, like ML-KEM, is based
   on the hardness of solving the Learning With Errors problem and a
   variant of the Short Integer Solution problem in module lattices
   (MLWE and SelfTargetMSIS).  Accordingly, this specification only
   defines ML-DSA in composite combination with EdDSA signature schemes.

1.2.3.  SLH-DSA

   SLH-DSA [FIPS-205] is a stateless hash-based signature scheme.  Its
   security relies on the hardness of finding preimages for
   cryptographic hash functions.  This feature is generally considered
   to be a high security guarantee.  Therefore, this specification
   defines SLH-DSA as a standalone signature scheme.

   In deployments the performance characteristics of SLH-DSA should be
   taken into account.  We refer to Section 10.1 for a discussion of the
   performance characteristics of this scheme.

1.3.  Elliptic Curve Cryptography

   The ECDH encryption is defined here as a KEM via X25519 and X448
   which are defined in [RFC7748].  EdDSA as defined in [RFC8032] is
   used as the elliptic curve-based digital signature scheme.

1.4.  Standalone and Multi-Algorithm Schemes

   This section provides a categorization of the new algorithms and
   their combinations.

1.4.1.  Standalone and Composite Multi-Algorithm Schemes

   This specification introduces new cryptographic schemes, which can be
   categorized as follows:

   *  PQ/T multi-algorithm public-key encryption, namely a composite
      combination of ML-KEM with an ECDH KEM,

   *  PQ/T multi-algorithm digital signature, namely composite
      combinations of ML-DSA with EdDSA signature schemes,

   *  PQ digital signature, namely SLH-DSA as a standalone cryptographic
      algorithm.

   For each of the composite schemes, this specification mandates that
   the consuming party has to successfully perform the cryptographic
   algorithms for each of the component schemes used in a cryptographic
   message, in order for the message to be deciphered and considered as
   valid.  This means that all component signatures must be verified
   successfully in order to achieve a successful verification of the
   composite signature.  In the case of the composite public-key
   decryption, each of the component KEM decapsulation operations must
   succeed.

1.4.2.  Non-Composite Algorithm Combinations

   As the OpenPGP protocol [RFC9580] allows for multiple signatures to
   be applied to a single message, it is also possible to realize non-
   composite combinations of signatures.  Furthermore, multiple OpenPGP
   signatures may be combined on the application layer.  These latter
   two cases realize non-composite combinations of signatures.
   Section 3.3 specifies how implementations should handle the
   verification of such combinations of signatures.

   Furthermore, the OpenPGP protocol also allows parallel encryption to
   different keys by using multiple PKESK packets, thus realizing non-
   composite multi-algorithm public-key encryption.

2.  Supported Public Key Algorithms

   This section specifies the composite ML-KEM + ECDH and ML-DSA + EdDSA
   schemes as well as the standalone SLH-DSA signature scheme.  All of
   these schemes are fully specified via their algorithm ID, i.e., they
   are not parametrized.

2.1.1.  Experimental Codepoints for Interop Testing

   [ Note: this section to be removed before publication ]

   Algorithms indicated as MAY are not assigned a codepoint in the
   current state of the draft in order to leave enough private/
   experimental code points available for other drafts.

   The use of private/experimental codepoints during development are
   intended to be used in non-released software only, for
   experimentation and interop testing purposes only.  An OpenPGP
   implementation MUST NOT produce a formal release using these
   experimental codepoints.  This draft will not be sent to IANA without
   every listed algorithm having a non-experimental codepoint.

3.  Algorithm Combinations

3.1.  Composite KEMs

   The ML-KEM + ECDH public-key encryption involves both the ML-KEM and
   an ECDH KEM in an a priori non-separable manner.  This is achieved
   via KEM combination, i.e. both key encapsulations/decapsulations are
   performed in parallel, and the resulting key shares are fed into a
   key combiner to produce a single shared secret for message
   encryption.

   As explained in Section 1.4.2, the OpenPGP protocol inherently
   supports parallel encryption to different keys.  Note that the
   confidentiality of a message is not post-quantum secure when
   encrypting to different keys if at least one key does not support PQ/
   T encryption schemes.  In Section 8.1 it is explained how to deal
   with multiple key scenarios.

3.2.  Composite Signatures

   The ML-DSA + EdDSA signature consists of independent ML-DSA and EdDSA
   signatures, and an implementation MUST successfully validate both
   signatures to state that the ML-DSA + EdDSA signature is valid.

3.3.  Multiple Signatures

   The OpenPGP message format allows multiple signatures of a message,
   i.e. the attachment of multiple signature packets.

   An implementation MAY sign a message with a traditional key and a
   PQ(/T) key from the same sender.  This ensures backwards
   compatibility due to [RFC9580, Section 5.2.5] (https://www.rfc-
   editor.org/rfc/rfc9580#section-5.2.5), since a legacy implementation
   without PQ(/T) support can fall back on the traditional signature.

   Newer implementations with PQ(/T) support MAY ignore the traditional
   signature(s) during validation.

   Implementations SHOULD consider the message correctly signed if at
   least one of the non-ignored signatures validates successfully.

   [Note to the reader: The last requirement, that one valid signature
   is sufficient to identify a message as correctly signed, is an
   interpretation of [RFC9580, Section 5.2.5] (https://www.rfc-
   editor.org/rfc/rfc9580#section-5.2.5).]

3.4.  ECC requirements

   Even though the zero point, also called the point at infinity, may
   occur as a result of arithmetic operations on points of an elliptic
   curve, it MUST NOT appear in any ECC data structure defined in this
   document.

   Furthermore, when performing the explicitly listed operations in
   Section 4.1.1.1 or Section 4.1.1.2 it is REQUIRED to follow the
   specification and security advisory mandated from the respective
   elliptic curve specification.

         Table 3: Montgomery curves parameters and artifact lengths

   The various procedures to perform the operations of an ECDH KEM are
   defined in the following subsections.  Specifically, each of these
   subsections defines the instances of the following operations:

   (ecdhCipherText, ecdhKeyShare) <- ECDH-KEM.Encaps(ecdhPublicKey)

   and

(ecdhKeyShare) <- ECDH-KEM.Decaps(ecdhSecretKey, ecdhCipherText, ecdhPublicKey)

   To instantiate ECDH-KEM, one must select a parameter set from
   Table 3.

   The encapsulation and decapsulation operations of x25519kem are
   described using the function X25519() and encodings defined in
   [RFC7748].  The ecdhSecretKey is denoted as r, the ecdhPublicKey as
   R, they are subject to the equation R = X25519(r, U(P)).  Here, U(P)
   denotes the u-coordinate of the base point of Curve25519.

   The operation x25519Kem.Encaps() is defined as follows:

   1.  Generate an ephemeral key pair {v, V} via V = X25519(v,U(P))
       where v is a randomly generated octet string with a length of 32
       octets

   2.  Compute the shared coordinate X = X25519(v, R) where R is the
       recipient's public key ecdhPublicKey

   3.  Set the output ecdhCipherText to V

   4.  Set the output ecdhKeyShare to SHA3-256(X || ecdhCipherText ||
       ecdhPublicKey)

   The operation x25519Kem.Decaps() is defined as follows:

   1.  Compute the shared coordinate X = X25519(r, V), where r is the
       ecdhSecretKey and V is the ecdhCipherText

   2.  Set the output ecdhKeyShare to SHA3-256(X || ecdhCipherText ||
       ecdhPublicKey)

4.1.1.2.  X448-KEM

   The encapsulation and decapsulation operations of x448kem are
   described using the function X448() and encodings defined in
   [RFC7748].  The ecdhSecretKey is denoted as r, the ecdhPublicKey as
   R, they are subject to the equation R = X25519(r, U(P)).  Here, U(P)
   denotes the u-coordinate of the base point of Curve448.

   The operation x448.Encaps() is defined as follows:

   1.  Generate an ephemeral key pair {v, V} via V = X448(v,U(P)) where
       v is a randomly generated octet string with a length of 56 octets

   2.  Compute the shared coordinate X = X448(v, R) where R is the
       recipient's public key ecdhPublicKey

   3.  Set the output ecdhCipherText to V

   4.  Set the output ecdhKeyShare to SHA3-512(X || ecdhCipherText ||
       ecdhPublicKey)

   The operation x448Kem.Decaps() is defined as follows:

   1.  Compute the shared coordinate X = X448(r, V), where r is the
       ecdhSecretKey and V is the ecdhCipherText

   2.  Set the output ecdhKeyShare to SHA3-512(X || ecdhCipherText ||
       ecdhPublicKey)

4.1.2.  ML-KEM

   ML-KEM features the following operations:

   (mlkemCipherText, mlkemKeyShare) <- ML-KEM.Encaps(mlkemPublicKey)

   and

   (mlkemKeyShare) <- ML-KEM.Decaps(mlkemCipherText, mlkemSecretKey)

   The above are the operations ML-KEM.Encaps and ML-KEM.Decaps defined
   in [FIPS-203].  Note that mlkemPublicKey is the encapsulation and
   mlkemSecretKey is the decapsulation key.

   ML-KEM has the parametrization with the corresponding artifact
   lengths in octets as given in Table 4.  All artifacts are encoded as
   defined in [FIPS-203].

   +==============+=============+========+========+============+=======+

   +--------------+-------------+--------+--------+------------+-------+

           Table 4: ML-KEM parameters artifact lengths in octets

   To instantiate ML-KEM, one must select a parameter set from the
   column "ML-KEM" of Table 4.

   The procedure to perform ML-KEM.Encaps() is as follows:

   1.  Invoke (mlkemCipherText, mlkemKeyShare) <- ML-
       KEM.Encaps(mlkemPublicKey), where mlkemPublicKey is the
       recipient's public key

   2.  Set mlkemCipherText as the ML-KEM ciphertext

   3.  Set mlkemKeyShare as the ML-KEM symmetric key share

   The procedure to perform ML-KEM.Decaps() is as follows:

   1.  Invoke mlkemKeyShare <- ML-KEM.Decaps(mlkemCipherText,
       mlkemSecretKey)

   2.  Set mlkemKeyShare as the ML-KEM symmetric key share

4.2.  Composite Encryption Schemes with ML-KEM

   Table 1 specifies the following ML-KEM + ECDH composite public-key
   encryption schemes:

           +========================+=============+===========+
           | Algorithm ID reference | ML-KEM      | ECDH-KEM  |
           +========================+=============+===========+
           |  TBD (105 for testing) | ML-KEM-768  | x25519Kem |
           +------------------------+-------------+-----------+
           |  TBD (106 for testing) | ML-KEM-1024 | x448Kem   |
           +------------------------+-------------+-----------+

                 Table 5: ML-KEM + ECDH composite schemes

   The ML-KEM + ECDH composite public-key encryption schemes are built
   according to the following principal design:

   *  The ML-KEM encapsulation algorithm is invoked to create an ML-KEM
      ciphertext together with an ML-KEM symmetric key share.

   *  The encapsulation algorithm of an ECDH KEM, namely X25519-KEM or
      X448-KEM, is invoked to create an ECDH ciphertext together with an
      ECDH symmetric key share.

   *  A Key-Encryption-Key (KEK) is computed as the output of a key
      combiner that receives as input both of the above created
      symmetric key shares and the protocol binding information.

   *  The session key for content encryption is then wrapped as
      described in [RFC3394] using AES-256 as algorithm and the KEK as
      key.

   *  The PKESK packet's algorithm-specific parts are made up of the ML-
      KEM ciphertext, the ECDH ciphertext, and the wrapped session key.

4.2.1.  Key combiner

   For the composite KEM schemes defined in Table 1 the following
   procedure MUST be used to compute the KEK that wraps a session key.
   The construction is a key derivation function compliant to
   [SP800-108], Section 4.4, based on KMAC256.  It is given by the
   following algorithm, which computes the key encryption key KEK that
   is used to wrap, i.e., encrypt, the session key.

//   multiKeyCombine(mlkemKeyShare, mlkemCipherText, mlkemPublicKey, ecdhKeyShare,
//                   ecdhCipherText, ecdhPublicKey, algId)
//
//   Input:
//   mlkemKeyShare   - the ML-KEM key share encoded as an octet string
//   mlkemCipherText - the ML-KEM ciphertext encoded as an octet string
//   mlkemPublicKey  - The ML-KEM public key of the recipient as an octet string
//   ecdhKeyShare    - the ECDH key share encoded as an octet string
//   ecdhCipherText  - the ECDH ciphertext encoded as an octet string
//   ecdhPublicKey   - The ECDH public key of the recipient as an octet string
//   algId           - the OpenPGP algorithm ID of the public-key encryption algorithm
//   domSep          – the UTF-8 encoding of the string "OpenPGPCompositeKDFv1"
//
//  domSep given in hexadecimal encoding := 4F 70 65 6E 50 47 50 43 6F 6D 70
//                                          6F 73 69 74 65 4B 44 46 76 31

KEK = KMAC256(mlkemKeyShare || ecdhKeyShare, mlkemCipherText || ecdhCipherText
              || mlkemPublicKey || ecdhPublicKey || algId, 256, domSep)
return KEK

   Here, the parameters to KMAC256 appear in the order as specified in
   [SP800-185], Section 4, i.e., the key K, main input data X, requested
   output length in bits L, and optional customization string S.

   Note that the values ecdhKeyShare defined in Section 4.1.1 and
   mlkemKeyShare defined in Section 4.1.2 already use the relative
   ciphertext in the derivation.  The ciphertext and public keys are by
   design included again in the key combiner to provide a robust
   security proof.

4.2.2.  Key generation procedure

   The implementation MUST generate the ML-KEM and the ECDH component
   keys independently.  ML-KEM key generation follows the specification
   [FIPS-203] and the artifacts are encoded as fixed-length octet
   strings as defined in Section 4.1.2.  For ECDH this is done following
   the relative specification in [RFC7748], and encoding the outputs as
   fixed-length octet strings in the format specified in Table 3.

4.2.3.  Encryption procedure

   The procedure to perform public-key encryption with an ML-KEM + ECDH
   composite scheme is as follows:

   1.  Take the recipient's authenticated public-key packet pkComposite
       and sessionKey as input

   2.  Parse the algorithm ID from pkComposite and set it as algId

   3.  Extract the ecdhPublicKey and mlkemPublicKey component from the
       algorithm specific data encoded in pkComposite with the format
       specified in Section 4.3.2.

   4.  Instantiate the ECDH-KEM and the ML-KEM depending on the
       algorithm ID according to Table 5

   5.  Compute (ecdhCipherText, ecdhKeyShare) := ECDH-
       KEM.Encaps(ecdhPublicKey)

   6.  Compute (mlkemCipherText, mlkemKeyShare) := ML-
       KEM.Encaps(mlkemPublicKey)

   7.  Compute KEK := multiKeyCombine(mlkemKeyShare, mlkemCipherText,
       mlkemPublicKey, ecdhKeyShare, ecdhCipherText, ecdhPublicKey,
       algId, 256) as defined in Section 4.2.1

   8.  Compute C := AESKeyWrap(KEK, sessionKey) with AES-256 as per
       [RFC3394] that includes a 64 bit integrity check

   9.  Output the algorithm specific part of the PKESK as
       ecdhCipherText || mlkemCipherText || len(C, symAlgId) (||
       symAlgId) || C, where both symAlgId and len(C, symAlgId) are
       single octet fields, symAlgId denotes the symmetric algorithm ID
       used and is present only for a v3 PKESK, and len(C, symAlgId)
       denotes the combined octet length of the fields specified as the
       arguments.

4.2.4.  Decryption procedure

   The procedure to perform public-key decryption with an ML-KEM + ECDH
   composite scheme is as follows:

   1.   Take the matching PKESK and own secret key packet as input

   2.   From the PKESK extract the algorithm ID as algId and the wrapped
        session key as encryptedKey

   3.   Check that the own and the extracted algorithm ID match

   4.   Parse the ecdhSecretKey and mlkemSecretKey from the algorithm
        specific data of the own secret key encoded in the format
        specified in Section 4.3.2

   5.   Instantiate the ECDH-KEM and the ML-KEM depending on the
        algorithm ID according to Table 5

   6.   Parse ecdhCipherText, mlkemCipherText, and C from encryptedKey
        encoded as ecdhCipherText || mlkemCipherText || len(C,symAlgId)
        (|| symAlgId) || C as specified in Section 4.3.1, where symAlgId
        is present only in the case of a v3 PKESK.

   7.   Compute (ecdhKeyShare) := ECDH-KEM.Decaps(ecdhCipherText,
        ecdhSecretKey, ecdhPublicKey)

   8.   Compute (mlkemKeyShare) := ML-KEM.Decaps(mlkemCipherText,
        mlkemSecretKey)

   9.   Compute KEK := multiKeyCombine(mlkemKeyShare, mlkemCipherText,
        mlkemPublicKey, ecdhKeyShare, ecdhCipherText, ecdhPublicKey,
        algId) as defined in Section 4.2.1

   10.  Compute sessionKey := AESKeyUnwrap(KEK, C) with AES-256 as per
        [RFC3394], aborting if the 64 bit integrity check fails

   11.  Output sessionKey

4.3.  Packet specifications

4.3.1.  Public-Key Encrypted Session Key Packets (Tag 1)

   The algorithm-specific fields consists of the output of the
   encryption procedure described in Section 4.2.3:

   *  A fixed-length octet string representing an ECDH ephemeral public
      key in the format associated with the curve as specified in
      Section 4.1.1.

   *  A fixed-length octet string of the ML-KEM ciphertext, whose length
      depends on the algorithm ID as specified in Table 4.

   *  A one-octet size of the following fields.

   *  Only in the case of a v3 PKESK packet: a one-octet symmetric
      algorithm identifier.

   *  The wrapped session key represented as an octet string.

   Note that like in the case of the algorithms X25519 and X448
   specified in [RFC9580], for the ML-KEM composite schemes, in the case
   of a v3 PKESK packet, the symmetric algorithm identifier is not
   encrypted.  Instead, it is placed in plaintext after the
   mlkemCipherText and before the length octet preceding the wrapped
   session key.  In the case of v3 PKESK packets for ML-KEM composite
   schemes, the symmetric algorithm used MUST be AES-128, AES-192 or
   AES-256 (algorithm ID 7, 8 or 9).

   In the case of a v3 PKESK, a receiving implementation MUST check if
   the length of the unwrapped symmetric key matches the symmetric
   algorithm identifier, and abort if this is not the case.

   Implementations MUST NOT use the obsolete Symmetrically Encrypted
   Data packet (tag 9) to encrypt data protected with the algorithms
   described in this document.

4.3.2.  Key Material Packets

   The composite ML-KEM + ECDH schemes MUST be used only with v6 keys,
   as defined in [RFC9580].

   The algorithm-specific public key is this series of values:

   *  A fixed-length octet string representing an EC point public key,
      in the point format associated with the curve specified in
      Section 4.1.1.

   *  A fixed-length octet string containing the ML-KEM public key,
      whose length depends on the algorithm ID as specified in Table 4.

   The algorithm-specific secret key is these two values:

   *  A fixed-length octet string of the encoded secret scalar, whose
      encoding and length depend on the algorithm ID as specified in
      Section 4.1.1.

   *  A fixed-length octet string containing the ML-KEM secret key in
      seed format, whose length is 64 octets (compare Table 4).  The
      seed format is defined in accordance with [FIPS-203], Section 3.3.
      Namely, the secret key is given by the concatenation of the values
      of d and z, generated in steps 1 and 2 of ML-KEM.KeyGen
      [FIPS-203], each of a length of 32 octets.  Upon parsing the
      private key format, or before using the secret key, for the
      expansion of the key, the function ML-KEM.KeyGen_internal
      [FIPS-203] has to be invoked with the parsed values of d and z as
      input.

5.  Composite Signature Schemes

5.1.  Building blocks

5.1.1.  EdDSA-Based signatures

   Throughout this specification EdDSA refers to the PureEdDSA variant
   defined in [RFC8032].

   To sign and verify with EdDSA the following operations are defined:

   (eddsaSignature) <- EdDSA.Sign(eddsaSecretKey, dataDigest)

   and

  (verified) <- EdDSA.Verify(eddsaPublicKey, eddsaSignature, dataDigest)

   The public and secret key, as well as the signature MUST be encoded
   according to [RFC8032] as fixed-length octet strings.  The following
   table describes the EdDSA parameters and artifact lengths:

     +==============+=========+=======+========+========+===========+
     | Algorithm ID | Curve   | Field | Public | Secret | Signature |
     |    reference |         | size  | key    | key    |           |

     +--------------+---------+-------+--------+--------+-----------+

         Table 6: EdDSA parameters and artifact lengths in octets

5.1.2.  ML-DSA signatures

   Throughout this specification ML-DSA refers to the pure version ML-
   DSA, i.e., in contrast to the pre-hash variant, defined in
   [FIPS-204].

   For ML-DSA signature generation the default hedged version of ML-
   DSA.Sign given in [FIPS-204] is used.  That is, to sign with ML-DSA
   the following operation is defined:

   (mldsaSignature) <- ML-DSA.Sign(mldsaSecretKey, dataDigest)

   For ML-DSA signature verification the algorithm ML-DSA.Verify given
   in [FIPS-204] is used.  That is, to verify with ML-DSA the following
   operation is defined:

 (verified) <- ML-DSA.Verify(mldsaPublicKey, dataDigest, mldsaSignature)

   ML-DSA has the parametrization with the corresponding artifact
   lengths in octets as given in Table 7.  All artifacts are encoded as
   defined in [FIPS-204].

   +========================+===========+========+========+===========+
   | Algorithm ID reference | ML-DSA    | Public | Secret | Signature |
   |                        |           | key    | key    | value     |

5.2.  Composite Signature Schemes with ML-DSA

5.2.1.  Signature data digest

   Signature data (i.e. the data to be signed) is digested prior to
   signing operations, see [RFC9580, Section 5.2.4] (https://www.rfc-
   editor.org/rfc/rfc9580#section-5.2.4).  Composite ML-DSA + EdDSA
   signatures MUST use the associated hash algorithm as specified in
   Table 8 for the signature data digest.  Signatures using other hash
   algorithms MUST be considered invalid.

   An implementation supporting a specific ML-DSA + EdDSA algorithm MUST
   also support the matching hash algorithm.

        +========================+===============+===============+
        | Algorithm ID reference | Hash function | Hash function |
        |                        |               | ID reference  |

                               data digest

5.2.2.  Key generation procedure

   The implementation MUST generate the ML-DSA and the EdDSA component
   keys independently.  ML-DSA key generation follows the specification
   [FIPS-204] and the artifacts are encoded as fixed-length octet
   strings as defined in Section 5.1.2.  For EdDSA this is done
   following the relative specification in [RFC7748], and encoding the
   artifacts as specified in Section 5.1.1 as fixed-length octet
   strings.

5.2.3.  Signature Generation

   To sign a message M with ML-DSA + EdDSA the following sequence of
   operations has to be performed:

   1.  Generate dataDigest according to [RFC9580, Section 5.2.4]
       (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9580#section-5.2.4)

   2.  Create the EdDSA signature over dataDigest with EdDSA.Sign() from
       Section 5.1.1

   3.  Create the ML-DSA signature over dataDigest with ML-DSA.Sign()
       from Section 5.1.2

   4.  Encode the EdDSA and ML-DSA signatures according to the packet
       structure given in Section 5.3.1.

5.2.4.  Signature Verification

   To verify an ML-DSA + EdDSA signature the following sequence of
   operations has to be performed:

   1.  Verify the EdDSA signature with EdDSA.Verify() from Section 5.1.1

   2.  Verify the ML-DSA signature with ML-DSA.Verify() from
       Section 5.1.2

   As specified in Section 3.2 an implementation MUST validate both
   signatures, i.e. EdDSA and ML-DSA, successfully to state that a
   composite ML-DSA + EdDSA signature is valid.

5.3.  Packet Specifications

5.3.1.  Signature Packet (Tag 2)

   The composite ML-DSA + EdDSA schemes MUST be used only with v6
   signatures, as defined in [RFC9580].

   The algorithm-specific v6 signature parameters for ML-DSA + EdDSA
   signatures consist of:

   *  A fixed-length octet string representing the EdDSA signature,
      whose length depends on the algorithm ID as specified in Table 6.

   *  A fixed-length octet string of the ML-DSA signature value, whose
      length depends on the algorithm ID as specified in Table 7.

5.3.2.  Key Material Packets

   The composite ML-DSA + EdDSA schemes MUST be used only with v6 keys,
   as defined in [RFC9580].

   The algorithm-specific public key for ML-DSA + EdDSA keys is this
   series of values:

   *  A fixed-length octet string representing the EdDSA public key,
      whose length depends on the algorithm ID as specified in Table 6.

   *  A fixed-length octet string containing the ML-DSA public key,
      whose length depends on the algorithm ID as specified in Table 7.

   The algorithm-specific secret key for ML-DSA + EdDSA keys is this
   series of values:

   *  A fixed-length octet string representing the EdDSA secret key,
      whose length depends on the algorithm ID as specified in Table 6.

   *  A fixed-length octet string containing the ML-DSA secret key in
      seed format, whose length is 32 octets (compare Table 7).  The
      seed format is defined in accordance with [FIPS-204],
      Section 3.6.3.  Namely, the secret key is given by the value xi
      generated in step 1 of ML-DSA.KeyGen [FIPS-204].  Upon parsing the
      private key format, or before using the secret key, for the
      expansion of the key, the function ML-DSA.KeyGen_internal

   Throughout this specification SLH-DSA refers to the pure SLH-DSA
   version defined in [FIPS-205].

6.1.  The SLH-DSA Algorithms

   The following table lists the group of algorithm code points for the
   SLH-DSA signature scheme and the corresponding artifact lengths.
   This group of algorithms is henceforth referred to as "SLH-DSA code
   points".

6.1.1.  Signature Data Digest

   Signature data (i.e. the data to be signed) is digested prior to
   signing operations, see [RFC9580, Section 5.2.4] (https://www.rfc-
   editor.org/rfc/rfc9580#section-5.2.4).  SLH-DSA signatures MUST use
   the associated hash algorithm as specified in Table 10 for the
   signature data digest.  Signatures using other hash algorithms MUST
   be considered invalid.

   An implementation supporting a specific SLH-DSA algorithm code point
   MUST also support the matching hash algorithm.

   DSA.Verify as specified in [FIPS-205].

6.2.  Packet specifications

6.2.1.  Signature Packet (Tag 2)

   The SLH-DSA algorithms MUST be used only with v6 signatures, as
   defined in [RFC9580, Section 5.2.3] (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/
   rfc9580#section-5.2.3).

   The algorithm-specific part of a signature packet for an SLH-DSA
   algorithm code point consists of:

      whose length depends on the algorithm ID as specified in Table 9.

   The algorithm-specific part of the secret key consists of:

   *  A fixed-length octet string containing the SLH-DSA secret key,
      whose length depends on the algorithm ID as specified in Table 9.

7.  Notes on Algorithms

7.1.  Symmetric Algorithms for SEIPD Packets

   Implementations MUST implement AES-256.  An implementation SHOULD use
   AES-256 in the case of a v1 SEIPD packet, or AES-256 with any
   available AEAD mode in the case of a v2 SEIPD packet, if all
   recipient certificates indicate support for it (explicitly or
   implicitly).

   A certificate that contains a PQ(/T) key SHOULD include AES-256 in
   the "Preferred Symmetric Ciphers for v1 SEIPD" subpacket and SHOULD
   include the pair AES-256 with OCB in the "Preferred AEAD
   Ciphersuites" subpacket.

   If AES-256 is not explicitly in the list of the "Preferred Symmetric
   Ciphers for v1 SEIPD" subpacket, and if the certificate contains a
   PQ/T key, it is implicitly at the end of the list.  This is justified
   since AES-256 is mandatory to implement.  If AES-128 is also
   implicitly added to the list, it is added after AES-256.

   If the pair AES-256 with OCB is not explicitly in the list of the
   "Preferred AEAD Ciphersuites" subpacket, and if the certificate
   contains a PQ/T key, it is implicitly at the end of the list.  This
   is justified since AES-256 and OCB are mandatory to implement.  If
   the pair AES-128 with OCB is also implicitly added to the list, it is
   added after the pair AES-256 with OCB.

7.2.  Hash Algorithms for Key Binding Signatures

   Subkey binding signatures over algorithms described in this document
   and primary key binding signatures made by algorithms described in
   this document MUST NOT be made with MD5, SHA-1, or RIPEMD-160.  A
   receiving implementation MUST treat such a signature as invalid.

8.  Migration Considerations

   The post-quantum KEM algorithms defined in Table 1 and the signature
   algorithms defined in Table 2 are a set of new public key algorithms
   that extend the algorithm selection of [RFC9580].  During the
   transition period, the post-quantum algorithms will not be supported
   by all clients.  Therefore various migration considerations must be
   taken into account, in particular backwards compatibility to existing
   implementations that have not yet been updated to support the post-
   quantum algorithms.

8.1.  Key preference

   Implementations SHOULD prefer PQ(/T) keys when multiple options are
   available.  When encrypting to a certificate that has both a valid
   PQ/T and a valid traditional encryption subkey, an implementation
   SHOULD use the PQ/T subkey only.  Furthermore, if an application has
   any means to determine that encrypting to a PQ/T certificate and a
   traditional certificate is redundant, it should omit encrypting to
   the traditional certificate.

   As specified in Section 3.1, the confidentiality of a message is not
   post-quantum secure when using multiple PKESKs if at least one does
   not use PQ/T encryption schemes.  An implementation SHOULD NOT abort
   the encryption process when encrypting a message to both PQ/T and
   traditional keys to allow for a smooth transition to post-quantum
   cryptography.

   An implementation MAY sign with both a PQ(/T) and an ECC key using
   multiple signatures over the same data as described in Section 3.3.
   Signing only with PQ(/T) key material is not backwards compatible.

8.2.  Key generation strategies

   It is RECOMMENDED to generate fresh secrets when generating PQ(/T)
   keys.  Note that reusing key material from existing ECC keys in
   PQ(/T) keys does not provide backwards compatibility.

   An OpenPGP certificate is composed of a certification-capable primary
   key and one or more subkeys for signature, encryption, and
   authentication.  Two migration strategies are recommended:

   1.  Generate two independent certificates, one for PQ(/T)-capable
       implementations, and one for legacy implementations.
       Implementations not understanding PQ(/T) certificates can use the
       legacy certificate, while PQ(/T)-capable implementations will
       prefer the newer certificate.  This allows having a traditional
       certificate for compatibility and a v6 PQ(/T) certificate, at a
       greater complexity in key distribution.

   2.  Attach PQ(/T) encryption or signature subkeys to an existing
       traditional v6 OpenPGP certificate.  Implementations
       understanding PQ(/T) will be able to parse and use the subkeys,
       while PQ(/T)-incapable implementations can gracefully ignore
       them.  This simplifies key distribution, as only one certificate
       needs to be communicated and verified, but leaves the primary key
       vulnerable to quantum computer attacks.

9.  Security Considerations

9.1.  Security Aspects of Composite Signatures

   When multiple signatures are applied to a message, the question of
   the protocol's resistance against signature stripping attacks
   naturally arises.  In a signature stripping attack, an adversary
   removes one or more of the signatures such that only a subset of the
   signatures remain in the message at the point when it is verified.
   This amounts to a downgrade attack that potentially reduces the value
   of the signature.  It should be noted that the composite signature
   schemes specified in this draft are not subject to a signature
   stripping vulnerability.  This is due to the fact that in any OpenPGP
   signature, the hashed meta data includes the signature algorithm ID,
   as specified in [RFC9580, Section 5.2.4] (https://www.rfc-
   editor.org/rfc/rfc9580#section-5.2.4).  As a consequence, a component
   signature taken out of the context of a specific composite algorithm
   is not a valid signature for any message.

   Furthermore, it is also not possible to craft a new signature for a
   message that was signed twice with a composite algorithm by
   interchanging (i.e., remixing) the component signatures, which would
   classify as a weak existential forgery.  This is due to the fact that
   each v6 signatures also includes a random salt at the start of the
   hashed meta data, as also specified in the aforementioned reference.

9.2.  Hashing in ECDH-KEM

   Our construction of the ECDH-KEMs, in particular the inclusion of
   ecdhCipherText in the final hashing step in encapsulation and
   decapsulation that produces the ecdhKeyShare, is standard and known
   as hashed ElGamal key encapsulation, a hashed variant of ElGamal
   encryption.  It ensures IND-CCA2 security in the random oracle model
   under some Diffie-Hellman intractability assumptions [CS03].  The
   additional inclusion of ecdhPublicKey follows the security advice in
   [RFC7748, Section 6.1] (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/
   rfc7748#section-6.1).

9.3.  Key combiner

   For the key combination in Section 4.2.1 this specification limits
   itself to the use of KMAC256 in a construction following [SP800-108].
   The sponge construction used by KMAC256 was proven to be
   indifferentiable from a random oracle [BDPA08].  This means, that in
   contrast to SHA2, which uses a Merkle-Damgard construction, no HMAC-
   based construction is required for key combination.  It is therefore
   sufficient to simply process the concatenation of any number of key
   shares with a domain separation when using a sponge-based
   construction like KMAC256.

   More precisely, for a given capacity c the indifferentiability proof
   shows that assuming there are no weaknesses found in the Keccak
   permutation, an attacker has to make an expected number of 2^(c/2)
   calls to the permutation to tell KMAC256 from a random oracle.  For a
   random oracle, a difference in only a single bit gives an unrelated,
   uniformly random output.  Hence, to be able to distinguish a key K,
   derived from shared keys K1 and K2 (with ciphertexts C1 and C2 and
   public keys P1 and P2) as

   K = KMAC256(K1 || K2, C1 || C2 || P1 || P2 || algId, 256, domSep)

   from a random bit string, an adversary has to know (or correctly
   guess) both key shares K1 and K2, entirely.

   The proposed construction in Section 4.2.1 preserves IND-CCA2 of any
   of its ingredient KEMs, i.e. the newly formed combined KEM is IND-
   CCA2 secure as long as at least one of the ingredient KEMs is.
   Indeed, the above stated indifferentiability from a random oracle
   qualifies Keccak as a split-key pseudorandom function as defined in
   [GHP18].  That is, Keccak behaves like a random function if at least
   one input shared secret is picked uniformly at random.  Our
   construction can thus be seen as an instantiation of the IND-CCA2
   preserving Example 3 in Figure 1 of [GHP18], up to some reordering of
   input shared secrets and ciphertexts.  In the random oracle setting,
   the reordering does not influence the arguments in [GHP18].

9.3.1.  Domain separation and binding

   The domSeparation information defined in Section 4.2.1 provides the
   domain separation for the key combiner construction.  This ensures
   that the input keying material is used to generate a KEK for a
   specific purpose or context.

   The algorithm ID, passed as the algID paramter to multiKeyCombine,
   binds the derived KEK to the chosen algorithm.  The input of the
   public keys into multiKeyCombine binds the KEK to the communication
   parties.  The algorithm ID identifies unequivocally the algorithm,
   the parameters for its instantiation, and the length of all
   artifacts, including the derived key.

   This is in line with the Recommendation for ECC in Section 5.5 of
   [SP800-56A].  Other fields included in the recommendation are not
   relevant for the OpenPGP protocol, since the sender is not required
   to have a key of their own, there are no pre-shared secrets, and all
   the other parameters are unequivocally defined by the algorithm ID.

9.4.  SLH-DSA Message Randomizer

   The specification of SLH-DSA [FIPS-205] prescribes an optional non-
   deterministic message randomizer.  This is not used in this
   specification, as OpenPGP v6 signatures already provide a salted
   signature data digest of the appropriate size.

9.5.  Binding hashes in signatures with signature algorithms

   In order not to extend the attack surface, we bind the hash algorithm
   used for signature data digestion to the hash algorithm used
   internally by the signature algorithm.

   ML-DSA internally uses a SHAKE256 digest, therefore we require SHA3
   in the ML-DSA + EdDSA signature packet, see Section 5.2.1.  Note that
   we bind a NIST security category 2 hash function to a signature
   algorithm that falls into NIST security category 3.  This does not
   constitute a security bottleneck: because of the unpredictable random
   salt that is prepended to the digested data in v6 signatures, the
   hardness assumption is not collision resistance but second-preimage
   resistance.

   In the case of SLH-DSA the internal hash algorithm varies based on
   the algorithm ID, see Section 6.1.1.

9.6.  Symmetric Algorithms for SEIPD Packets

   This specification mandates support for AES-256 for two reasons.
   First, AES-KeyWrap with AES-256 is already part of the composite KEM
   construction.  Second, some of the PQ(/T) algorithms target the
   security level of AES-256.

   For the same reasons, this specification further recommends the use
   of AES-256 if it is supported by all recipient certificates,
   regardless of what the implementation would otherwise choose based on
   the recipients' preferences.  This recommendation should be
   understood as a clear and simple rule for the selection of AES-256
   for encryption.  Implementations may also make more nuanced
   decisions.

9.7.  Key generation

   When generating keys, this specification requires component keys to
   be generated independently, and recommends not to reuse existing keys
   for any of the components.  Note that reusing a key across different
   protocols may lead to signature confusion vulnerabilities, that
   formally classify as signature forgeries.  Generally, reusing a key
   for different purposes may lead to subtle vulnerabilities.

10.  Additional considerations

10.1.  Performance Considerations for SLH-DSA

   This specification introduces both ML-DSA + EdDSA as well as SLH-DSA
   as PQ(/T) signature schemes.

   Generally, it can be said that ML-DSA + EdDSA provides a performance
   in terms of execution time requirements that is close to that of
   traditional ECC signature schemes.  Regarding the size of signatures
   and public keys, though, ML-DSA has far greater requirements than
   traditional schemes like EC-based or even RSA signature schemes.

   Implementers may want to offer SLH-DSA for applications where the
   weaker security assumptions of a hash-based signature scheme are
   required – namely only the 2nd preimage resistance of a hash function
   – and thus a potentially higher degree of trust in the long-term
   security of signatures is achieved.  However, SLH-DSA has performance
   characteristics in terms of execution time of the signature
   generation as well as space requirements for the signature that are
   even greater than those of ML-DSA + EdDSA signature schemes.

   Pertaining to the execution time, the particularly costly operation
   in SLH-DSA is the signature generation.  Depending on the parameter
   set, it can range from approximately the one hundred fold to more
   than the two thousand fold of that of ML-DSA-87.  These number are
   based on the performance measurements published in the NIST
   submissions for SLH-DSA and ML-DSA.  In order to achieve fast
   signature generation times, the algorithm SLH-DSA-SHAKE-128f ("f"
   standing for "fast") should be chosen.  This comes at the expense of
   a larger signature size.  This choice can be relevant in applications
   where mass signing occurs or a small latency is required.

   In order to minimize the space requirements of an SLH-DSA signature,
   an algorithm ID with the name ending in "s" for "small" should be
   chosen.  This comes at the expense of a longer signature generation
   time.  In particular, SLH-DSA-SHAKE-128s achieves the smallest
   possible signature size, which is about the double size of an ML-
   DSA-87 signature.  Where a higher security level than 128 bit is
   needed, SLH-DSA-SHAKE-256s can be used.

   Unlike the signature generation time, the signature verification time
   of SLH-DSA is not that much larger than that of other PQC schemes.
   Based on the performance measurements published in the NIST
   submissions for SLH-DSA and ML-DSA, the verification time of the SLH-
   DSA is, for the parameters covered by this specification, larger than
   that of ML-DSA-87 by a factor ranging from four (for -128s) over nine
   (for -256s) to twelve (for -128f).

11.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add the algorithm IDs defined in Table 11 to the
   existing registry OpenPGP Public Key Algorithms.  The field
   specifications enclosed in brackets for the ML-KEM + ECDH composite
   algorithms denote fields that are only conditionally contained in the
   data structure.
