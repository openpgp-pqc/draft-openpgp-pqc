--- abstract

This document defines a post-quantum public-key algorithm extension for the OpenPGP protocol.
Given the generally assumed threat of a cryptographically relevant quantum computer, this extension provides a basis for long-term secure OpenPGP signatures and ciphertexts.
Specifically, it defines composite public-key encryption based on ML-KEM (formerly CRYSTALS-Kyber), composite public-key signatures based on ML-DSA (formerly CRYSTALS-Dilithium), both in combination with elliptic curve cryptography, and SLH-DSA-SHAKE (formerly SPHINCS+) as a standalone public key signature scheme.

# Introduction

The OpenPGP protocol supports various traditional public-key algorithms based on the factoring or discrete logarithm problem.
As the security of algorithms based on these mathematical problems is endangered by the advent of quantum computers, there is a need to extend OpenPGP by algorithms that remain secure in the presence of quantum computers.

Such cryptographic algorithms are referred to as post-quantum cryptography.
The algorithms defined in this extension were chosen for standardization by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in mid 2022 {{NISTIR-8413}} as the result of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization process initiated in 2016 {{NIST-PQC}}.
Namely, these are ML-KEM {{FIPS-203}} as a Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM), a KEM being a modern building block for public-key encryption, and ML-DSA {{FIPS-204}} as well as SLH-DSA-SHAKE {{FIPS-205}} as signature schemes.

For the two ML-* schemes, this document follows the conservative strategy to deploy post-quantum in combination with traditional schemes such that the security is retained even if all schemes but one in the combination are broken.
In contrast, the stateless hash-based signature scheme SLH-DSA-SHAKE is considered to be sufficiently well understood with respect to its security assumptions in order to be used standalone.
To this end, this document specifies the following new set: SLH-DSA-SHAKE standalone and the two ML-* as composite with ECC-based KEM and digital signature schemes.
Here, the term "composite" indicates that any data structure or algorithm pertaining to the combination of the two components appears as single data structure or algorithm from the protocol perspective.

The document specifies the conventions for interoperability between compliant OpenPGP implementations that make use of this extension and the newly defined algorithms or algorithm combinations.

## Conventions used in this Document

### Terminology for Multi-Algorithm Schemes

The terminology in this document is oriented towards the definitions in {{?I-D.ietf-pquip-pqt-hybrid-terminology}}.
Specifically, the terms "multi-algorithm", "composite" and "non-composite" are used in correspondence with the definitions therein.
The abbreviation "PQ" is used for post-quantum schemes.
To denote the combination of post-quantum and traditional schemes, the abbreviation "PQ/T" is used.
The short form "PQ(/T)" stands for PQ or PQ/T.

## Post-Quantum Cryptography

This section describes the individual post-quantum cryptographic schemes.
All schemes listed here are believed to provide security in the presence of a cryptographically relevant quantum computer.
However, the mathematical problems on which the two ML-* schemes and SLH-DSA-SHAKE are based, are fundamentally different, and accordingly the level of trust commonly placed in them as well as their performance characteristics vary.

\[Note to the reader: This specification refers to the NIST PQC draft standards FIPS 203, FIPS 204, and FIPS 205 as if they were a final specification.
This is a temporary solution until the final versions of these documents are available.
The goal is to provide a sufficiently precise specification of the algorithms already at the draft stage of this specification, so that it is possible for implementers to create interoperable implementations.
Furthermore, we want to point out that, depending on possible future changes to the draft standards by NIST, this specification may be updated as soon as corresponding information becomes available.\]

### ML-KEM {#mlkem-intro}

ML-KEM [FIPS-203] is based on the hardness of solving the learning-with-errors problem in module lattices (MLWE).
The scheme is believed to provide security against cryptanalytic attacks by classical as well as quantum computers.
This specification defines ML-KEM only in composite combination with ECDH encryption schemes in order to provide a pre-quantum security fallback.

### ML-DSA {#mldsa-intro}

ML-DSA [FIPS-204] is a signature scheme that, like ML-KEM, is based on the hardness of solving the Learning With Errors problem and a variant of the Short Integer Solution problem in module lattices (MLWE and SelfTargetMSIS).
Accordingly, this specification only defines ML-DSA in composite combination with EdDSA signature schemes.

### SLH-DSA-SHAKE

SLH-DSA-SHAKE [FIPS-205] is a stateless hash-based signature scheme.
Its security relies on the hardness of finding preimages for cryptographic hash functions.
This feature is generally considered to be a high security guarantee.
Therefore, this specification defines SLH-DSA-SHAKE as a standalone signature scheme.

In deployments the performance characteristics of SLH-DSA-SHAKE should be taken into account.
We refer to {{performance-considerations}} for a discussion of the performance characteristics of this scheme.

## Elliptic Curve Cryptography

The ECDH encryption is defined here as a KEM.
Curve25519 and Curve448 are defined in [RFC7748] for use in a Diffie-Hellman key agreement scheme and defined in [RFC8032] for use in a digital signature scheme.

## Standalone and Multi-Algorithm Schemes {#multi-algo-schemes}

This section provides a categorization of the new algorithms and their combinations.

### Standalone and Composite Multi-Algorithm Schemes {#composite-multi-alg}

This specification introduces new cryptographic schemes, which can be categorized as follows:

 - PQ/T multi-algorithm public-key encryption, namely a composite combination of ML-KEM with an ECDH KEM,

 - PQ/T multi-algorithm digital signature, namely composite combinations of ML-DSA with EdDSA signature schemes,

 - PQ digital signature, namely SLH-DSA-SHAKE as a standalone cryptographic algorithm.

For each of the composite schemes, this specification mandates that the recipient has to successfully perform the cryptographic algorithms for each of the component schemes used in a cryptographic message, in order for the message to be deciphered and considered as valid.
This means that all component signatures must be verified successfully in order to achieve a successful verification of the composite signature.
In the case of the composite public-key decryption, each of the component KEM decapsulation operations must succeed.

### Non-Composite Algorithm Combinations {#non-composite-multi-alg}

As the OpenPGP protocol [I-D.ietf-openpgp-crypto-refresh] allows for multiple signatures to be applied to a single message, it is also possible to realize non-composite combinations of signatures.
Furthermore, multiple OpenPGP signatures may be combined on the application layer.
These latter two cases realize non-composite combinations of signatures.
{{multiple-signatures}} specifies how implementations should handle the verification of such combinations of signatures.

Furthermore, the OpenPGP protocol also allows for parallel encryption to different keys held by the same recipient.
Accordingly, if the sender makes use of this feature and sends an encrypted message with multiple PKESK packages for different encryption keys held by the same recipient, a non-composite multi-algorithm public-key encryption is realized where the recipient has to decrypt only one of the PKESK packages in order to decrypt the message.
See {{no-pq-t-parallel-encryption}} for restrictions on parallel encryption mandated by this specification.

# Supported Public Key Algorithms

This section specifies the composite ML-KEM + ECDH and ML-DSA + EdDSA schemes as well as the standalone SLH-DSA-SHAKE signature scheme.
All of these schemes are fully specified via their algorithm ID, i.e., they are not parametrized.

## Algorithm Specifications

For encryption, the following composite KEM schemes are specified:

{: title="KEM algorithm specifications" #kem-alg-specs}
ID                    | Algorithm                          | Requirement | Definition
---------------------:| ---------------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------
TBD (105 for testing) | ML-KEM-768 + X25519                | MUST        | {{ecc-mlkem}}
TBD (106 for testing) | ML-KEM-1024 + X448                 | SHOULD      | {{ecc-mlkem}}

For signatures, the following (composite) signature schemes are specified:

{: title="Signature algorithm specifications" #sig-alg-specs}
ID                    | Algorithm                          | Requirement | Definition
---------------------:| ---------------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------
TBD (107 for testing) | ML-DSA-65 + Ed25519                | MUST        | {{ecc-mldsa}}
TBD (108 for testing) | ML-DSA-87 + Ed448                  | SHOULD      | {{ecc-mldsa}}
TBD (109 for testing) | SLH-DSA-SHAKE-128s                 | MAY         | {{slhdsa}}
TBD                   | SLH-DSA-SHAKE-128f                 | MAY         | {{slhdsa}}
TBD                   | SLH-DSA-SHAKE-256s                 | MAY         | {{slhdsa}}

### Experimental Codepoints for Interop Testing

\[ Note: this section to be removed before publication \]

Algorithms indicated as MAY are not assigned a codepoint in the current state of the draft since there are not enough private/experimental code points available to cover all newly introduced public-key algorithm identifiers.

The use of private/experimental codepoints during development are intended to be used in non-released software only, for experimentation and interop testing purposes only.
An OpenPGP implementation MUST NOT produce a formal release using these experimental codepoints.
This draft will not be sent to IANA without every listed algorithm having a non-experimental codepoint.

# Algorithm Combinations

## Composite KEMs

The ML-KEM + ECDH public-key encryption involves both the ML-KEM and an ECDH KEM in an a priori non-separable manner.
This is achieved via KEM combination, i.e. both key encapsulations/decapsulations are performed in parallel, and the resulting key shares are fed into a key combiner to produce a single shared secret for message encryption.

## Parallel Public-Key Encryption {#no-pq-t-parallel-encryption}

As explained in {{non-composite-multi-alg}}, the OpenPGP protocol inherently supports parallel encryption to different keys of the same recipient.
Implementations MUST NOT encrypt a message with a purely traditional public-key encryption key of a recipient if it is encrypted with a PQ/T key of the same recipient.

## Composite Signatures

The ML-DSA + EdDSA signature consists of independent ML-DSA and EdDSA signatures, and an implementation MUST successfully validate both signatures to state that the ML-DSA + EdDSA signature is valid.

## Multiple Signatures {#multiple-signatures}

The OpenPGP message format allows multiple signatures of a message, i.e. the attachment of multiple signature packets.

An implementation MAY sign a message with a traditional key and a PQ(/T) key from the same sender.
This ensures backwards compatibility due to {{I-D.ietf-openpgp-crypto-refresh}} Section 5.2.5, since a legacy implementation without PQ(/T) support can fall back on the traditional signature.

Newer implementations with PQ(/T) support MAY ignore the traditional signature(s) during validation.

Implementations SHOULD consider the message correctly signed if at least one of the non-ignored signatures validates successfully.

\[Note to the reader: The last requirement, that one valid signature is sufficient to identify a message as correctly signed, is an interpretation of {{I-D.ietf-openpgp-crypto-refresh}} Section 5.2.5.\]

## ECC requirements

Even though the zero point, also called the point at infinity, may occur as a result of arithmetic operations on points of an elliptic curve, it MUST NOT appear in any ECC data structure defined in this document.

Furthermore, when performing the explicitly listed operations in {{x25519-kem}} or {{x448-kem}} it is REQUIRED to follow the specification and security advisory mandated from the respective elliptic curve specification.

# Composite KEM schemes

## Building Blocks

### ECDH KEMs {#ecc-kem}

In this section we define the encryption, decryption, and data formats for the ECDH component of the composite algorithms.

{{tab-ecdh-cfrg-artifacts}} describes the ECDH-KEM parameters and artifact lengths.
The artifacts in {{tab-ecdh-cfrg-artifacts}} follow the encodings described in [RFC7748].

The various procedures to perform the operations of an ECDH KEM are defined in the following subsections.
Specifically, each of these subsections defines the instances of the following operations:

    (ecdhCipherText, ecdhKeyShare) <- ECDH-KEM.Encaps(ecdhPublicKey)

and

    (ecdhKeyShare) <- ECDH-KEM.Decaps(ecdhSecretKey, ecdhCipherText, ecdhPublicKey)

To instantiate `ECDH-KEM`, one must select a parameter set from {{tab-ecdh-cfrg-artifacts}}.

#### X25519-KEM {#x25519-kem}

The encapsulation and decapsulation operations of `x25519kem` are described using the function `X25519()` and encodings defined in [RFC7748].
The `ecdhSecretKey` is denoted as `r`, the `ecdhPublicKey` as `R`, they are subject to the equation `R = X25519(r, U(P))`.
Here, `U(P)` denotes the u-coordinate of the base point of Curve25519.

The operation `x25519Kem.Encaps()` is defined as follows:

 1. Generate an ephemeral key pair {`v`, `V`} via `V = X25519(v,U(P))` where `v` is a randomly generated octet string with a length of 32 octets

 2. Compute the shared coordinate `X = X25519(v, R)` where `R` is the recipient's public key `ecdhPublicKey`

 3. Set the output `ecdhCipherText` to `V`

 4. Set the output `ecdhKeyShare` to `SHA3-256(X || ecdhCipherText || ecdhPublicKey)`

The operation `x25519Kem.Decaps()` is defined as follows:

 1. Compute the shared coordinate `X = X25519(r, V)`, where `r` is the `ecdhSecretKey` and `V` is the `ecdhCipherText`

 2. Set the output `ecdhKeyShare` to `SHA3-256(X || ecdhCipherText || ecdhPublicKey)`

#### X448-KEM {#x448-kem}

The encapsulation and decapsulation operations of `x448kem` are described using the function `X448()` and encodings defined in [RFC7748].
The `ecdhSecretKey` is denoted as `r`, the `ecdhPublicKey` as `R`, they are subject to the equation `R = X25519(r, U(P))`.
Here, `U(P)` denotes the u-coordinate of the base point of Curve448.

The operation `x448.Encaps()` is defined as follows:

 1. Generate an ephemeral key pair {`v`, `V`} via `V = X448(v,U(P))` where `v` is a randomly generated octet string with a length of 56 octets

 2. Compute the shared coordinate `X = X448(v, R)` where `R` is the recipient's public key `ecdhPublicKey`

 3. Set the output `ecdhCipherText` to `V`

 4. Set the output `ecdhKeyShare` to `SHA3-512(X || ecdhCipherText || ecdhPublicKey)`

The operation `x448Kem.Decaps()` is defined as follows:

 1. Compute the shared coordinate `X = X448(r, V)`, where `r` is the `ecdhSecretKey` and `V` is the `ecdhCipherText`

 2. Set the output `ecdhKeyShare` to `SHA3-512(X || ecdhCipherText || ecdhPublicKey)`

### ML-KEM {#mlkem-ops}

ML-KEM features the following operations:

    (mlkemCipherText, mlkemKeyShare) <- ML-KEM.Encaps(mlkemPublicKey)

and

    (mlkemKeyShare) <- ML-KEM.Decaps(mlkemCipherText, mlkemSecretKey)

The above are the operations `ML-KEM.Encaps` and `ML-KEM.Decaps` defined in [FIPS-203].
Note that `mlkemPublicKey` is the encapsulation and `mlkemSecretKey` is the decapsulation key.

ML-KEM has the parametrization with the corresponding artifact lengths in octets as given in {{tab-mlkem-artifacts}}.
All artifacts are encoded as defined in [FIPS-203].

{: title="ML-KEM parameters artifact lengths in octets" #tab-mlkem-artifacts}
Algorithm ID reference | ML-KEM      | Public key | Secret key | Ciphertext | Key share
----------------------:| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------
TBD (105 for testing)  | ML-KEM-768  | 1184       | 2400       | 1088       | 32
TBD (106 for testing)  | ML-KEM-1024 | 1568       | 3168       | 1568       | 32

To instantiate `ML-KEM`, one must select a parameter set from the column "ML-KEM" of {{tab-mlkem-artifacts}}.

The procedure to perform `ML-KEM.Encaps()` is as follows:

 1. Invoke `(mlkemCipherText, mlkemKeyShare) <- ML-KEM.Encaps(mlkemPublicKey)`, where `mlkemPublicKey` is the recipient's public key

 2. Set `mlkemCipherText` as the ML-KEM ciphertext

 3. Set `mlkemKeyShare` as the ML-KEM symmetric key share

The procedure to perform `ML-KEM.Decaps()` is as follows:

 1. Invoke `mlkemKeyShare <-  ML-KEM.Decaps(mlkemCipherText, mlkemSecretKey)`

 2. Set `mlkemKeyShare` as the ML-KEM symmetric key share

## Composite Encryption Schemes with ML-KEM {#ecc-mlkem}

{{kem-alg-specs}} specifies the following ML-KEM + ECDH composite public-key encryption schemes:

{: title="ML-KEM + ECDH composite schemes" #tab-mlkem-ecc-composite}
Algorithm ID reference                   | ML-KEM       | ECDH-KEM
----------------------------------------:| ------------ | ---------
TBD (105 for testing)                    | ML-KEM-768   | x25519Kem
TBD (106 for testing)                    | ML-KEM-1024  | x448Kem

The ML-KEM + ECDH composite public-key encryption schemes are built according to the following principal design:

 - The ML-KEM encapsulation algorithm is invoked to create an ML-KEM ciphertext together with an ML-KEM symmetric key share.

 - The encapsulation algorithm of an ECDH KEM, namely X25519-KEM or X448-KEM, is invoked to create an ECDH ciphertext together with an ECDH symmetric key share.

 - A Key-Encryption-Key (KEK) is computed as the output of a key combiner that receives as input both of the above created symmetric key shares and the protocol binding information.

 - The session key for content encryption is then wrapped as described in {{RFC3394}} using AES-256 as algorithm and the KEK as key.

 - The PKESK package's algorithm-specific parts are made up of the ML-KEM ciphertext, the ECDH ciphertext, and the wrapped session key.

### Fixed information {#kem-fixed-info}

For the composite KEM schemes defined in {{kem-alg-specs}} the following procedure, justified in {{sec-fixed-info}}, MUST be used to derive a string to use as binding between the KEK and the communication parties.

    //   Input:
    //   algID     - the algorithm ID encoded as octet

    fixedInfo = algID

### Key combiner {#kem-key-combiner}

For the composite KEM schemes defined in {{kem-alg-specs}} the following procedure MUST be used to compute the KEK that wraps a session key.
The construction is a one-step key derivation function compliant to {{SP800-56C}} Section 4, based on KMAC256 {{SP800-185}}.
It is given by the following algorithm, which computes the key encryption key `KEK` that is used to wrap, i.e., encrypt, the session key.

    //   multiKeyCombine(ecdhKeyShare, ecdhCipherText,
    //                   mlkemKeyShare, mlkemCipherText,
    //                   fixedInfo, oBits)
    //
    //   Input:
    //   ecdhKeyShare     - the ECDH key share encoded as an octet string
    //   ecdhCipherText   - the ECDH ciphertext encoded as an octet string
    //   mlkemKeyShare   - the ML-KEM key share encoded as an octet string
    //   mlkemCipherText - the ML-KEM ciphertext encoded as an octet string
    //   fixedInfo       - the fixed information octet string
    //   oBits           - the size of the output keying material in bits
    //
    //   Constants:
    //   domSeparation       - the UTF-8 encoding of the string
    //                         "OpenPGPCompositeKeyDerivationFunction"
    //   counter             - the 4 byte value 00 00 00 01
    //   customizationString - the UTF-8 encoding of the string "KDF"

    ecdhData = ecdhKeyShare || ecdhCipherText
    mlkemData = mlkemKeyShare || mlkemCipherText
    encData = counter || ecdhData || mlkemData || fixedInfo

    KEK = KMAC256(domSeparation, encData, oBits, customizationString)
    return KEK

Here, the parameters to KMAC256 appear in the order as specified in {{SP800-186}}, Section 4, i.e., the key `K`, main input data `X`, requested output length `L`, and optional customization string `S` in that order.

Note that the values `ecdhKeyShare` defined in {{ecc-kem}} and `mlkemKeyShare` defined in {{mlkem-ops}} already use the relative ciphertext in the derivation.
The ciphertext is by design included again in the key combiner to provide a robust security proof.

The value of `domSeparation` is the UTF-8 encoding of the string "OpenPGPCompositeKeyDerivationFunction" and MUST be the following octet sequence:

    domSeparation := 4F 70 65 6E 50 47 50 43 6F 6D 70 6F 73 69 74 65
                     4B 65 79 44 65 72 69 76 61 74 69 6F 6E 46 75 6E
                     63 74 69 6F 6E

The value of `counter` MUST be set to the following octet sequence:

    counter :=  00 00 00 01

The value of `fixedInfo` MUST be set according to {{kem-fixed-info}}.

The value of `customizationString` is the UTF-8 encoding of the string "KDF" and MUST be set to the following octet sequence:

    customizationString := 4B 44 46

### Key generation procedure {#ecc-mlkem-generation}

The implementation MUST independently generate the ML-KEM and the ECDH component keys.
ML-KEM key generation follows the specification [FIPS-203] and the artifacts are encoded as fixed-length octet strings as defined in {{mlkem-ops}}.
For ECDH this is done following the relative specification in {{RFC7748}}, and encoding the outputs as fixed-length octet strings in the format specified in {{tab-ecdh-cfrg-artifacts}}.

### Encryption procedure {#ecc-mlkem-encryption}

The procedure to perform public-key encryption with an ML-KEM + ECDH composite scheme is as follows:

 1. Take the recipient's authenticated public-key packet `pkComposite` and `sessionKey` as input

 2. Parse the algorithm ID from `pkComposite`

 3. Extract the `ecdhPublicKey` and `mlkemPublicKey` component from the algorithm specific data encoded in `pkComposite` with the format specified in {{mlkem-ecc-key}}.

 4. Instantiate the ECDH-KEM and the ML-KEM depending on the algorithm ID according to {{tab-mlkem-ecc-composite}}

 5. Compute `(ecdhCipherText, ecdhKeyShare) := ECDH-KEM.Encaps(ecdhPublicKey)`

 6. Compute `(mlkemCipherText, mlkemKeyShare) := ML-KEM.Encaps(mlkemPublicKey)`

 7. Compute `fixedInfo` as specified in {{kem-fixed-info}}

 8. Compute `KEK := multiKeyCombine(ecdhKeyShare, ecdhCipherText, mlkemKeyShare, mlkemCipherText, fixedInfo, oBits=256)` as defined in {{kem-key-combiner}}

 9. Compute `C := AESKeyWrap(KEK, sessionKey)` with AES-256 as per {{RFC3394}} that includes a 64 bit integrity check

 10. Output the algorithm specific part of the PKESK as `ecdhCipherText || mlkemCipherText (|| symAlgId) || len(C) || C`, where both `symAlgId` and `len(C)` are single octet fields and `symAlgId` denotes the symmetric algorithm ID used and is present only for a v3 PKESK

### Decryption procedure

The procedure to perform public-key decryption with an ML-KEM + ECDH composite scheme is as follows:

 1. Take the matching PKESK and own secret key packet as input

 2. From the PKESK extract the algorithm ID and the `encryptedKey`, i.e., the wrapped session key

 3. Check that the own and the extracted algorithm ID match

 4. Parse the `ecdhSecretKey` and `mlkemSecretKey` from the algorithm specific data of the own secret key encoded in the format specified in {{mlkem-ecc-key}}

 5. Instantiate the ECDH-KEM and the ML-KEM depending on the algorithm ID according to {{tab-mlkem-ecc-composite}}

 6. Parse `ecdhCipherText`, `mlkemCipherText`, and `C` from `encryptedKey` encoded as `ecdhCipherText || mlkemCipherText (|| symAlgId) || len(C) || C` as specified in {{ecc-mlkem-pkesk}}, where `symAlgId` is present only in the case of a v3 PKESK.

 7. Compute `(ecdhKeyShare) := ECDH-KEM.Decaps(ecdhCipherText, ecdhSecretKey, ecdhPublicKey)`

 8. Compute `(mlkemKeyShare) := ML-KEM.Decaps(mlkemCipherText, mlkemSecretKey)`

 9. Compute `fixedInfo` as specified in {{kem-fixed-info}}

 10. Compute `KEK := multiKeyCombine(ecdhKeyShare, ecdhCipherText, mlkemKeyShare, mlkemCipherText, fixedInfo, oBits=256)` as defined in {{kem-key-combiner}}

 11. Compute `sessionKey := AESKeyUnwrap(KEK, C)`  with AES-256 as per {{RFC3394}}, aborting if the 64 bit integrity check fails

 12. Output `sessionKey`

## Packet specifications

### Public-Key Encrypted Session Key Packets (Tag 1) {#ecc-mlkem-pkesk}

The algorithm-specific fields consists of the output of the encryption procedure described in {{ecc-mlkem-encryption}}:

 - A fixed-length octet string representing an ECDH ephemeral public key in the format associated with the curve as specified in {{ecc-kem}}.

 - A fixed-length octet string of the ML-KEM ciphertext, whose length depends on the algorithm ID as specified in {{tab-mlkem-artifacts}}.

 - A one-octet size of the following fields.

 - Only in the case of a v3 PKESK packet: a one-octet symmetric algorithm identifier.

 - The wrapped session key represented as an octet string.

Note that like in the case of the algorithms X25519 and X448 specified in {{I-D.ietf-openpgp-crypto-refresh}}, for the ML-KEM composite schemes, in the case of a v3 PKESK packet, the symmetric algorithm identifier is not encrypted.
Instead, it is placed in plaintext after the `mlkemCipherText` and before the length octet preceding the wrapped session key.
In the case of v3 PKESK packets for ML-KEM composite schemes, the symmetric algorithm used MUST be AES-128, AES-192 or AES-256 (algorithm ID 7, 8 or 9).

In the case of a v3 PKESK, a receiving implementation MUST check if the length of the unwrapped symmetric key matches the symmetric algorithm identifier, and abort if this is not the case.


### Key Material Packets {#mlkem-ecc-key}

The algorithm-specific public key is this series of values:

 - A fixed-length octet string representing an EC point public key, in the point format associated with the curve specified in {{ecc-kem}}.

 - A fixed-length octet string containing the ML-KEM public key, whose length depends on the algorithm ID as specified in {{tab-mlkem-artifacts}}.

The algorithm-specific secret key is these two values:

 - A fixed-length octet string of the encoded secret scalar, whose encoding and length depend on the algorithm ID as specified in {{ecc-kem}}.

 - A fixed-length octet string containing the ML-KEM secret key, whose length depends on the algorithm ID as specified in {{tab-mlkem-artifacts}}.

# Notes on Algorithms

## Symmetric Algorithms for SEIPD Packets

Implementations MUST implement `AES-256`.
An implementation SHOULD use `AES-256` in the case of a v1 SEIPD packet, or `AES-256` with any available AEAD mode in the case of a v2 SEIPD packet, if all recipients indicate support for it (explicitly or implicitly).

A v4 or v6 certificate that contains a PQ(/T) key SHOULD include `AES-256` in the "Preferred Symmetric Ciphers for v1 SEIPD" subpacket.
A v6 certificate that contains a PQ(/T) key SHOULD include the pair `AES-256` with `OCB` in the "Preferred AEAD Ciphersuites" subpacket.

If `AES-256` is not explicitly in the list of the "Preferred Symmetric Ciphers for v1 SEIPD" subpacket, and if the certificate contains a PQ/T key, it is implicitly at the end of the list.
This is justified since `AES-256` is mandatory to implement.
If `AES-128` is also implicitly added to the list, it is added after `AES-256`.

If the pair `AES-256` with `OCB` is not explicitly in the list of the "Preferred AEAD Ciphersuites" subpacket, and if the certificate contains a PQ/T key, it is implicitly at the end of the list.
This is justified since `AES-256` and `OCB` are mandatory to implement.
If the pair `AES-128` with `OCB` is also implicitly added to the list, it is added after the pair `AES-256` with `OCB`.

# Migration Considerations

The post-quantum KEM algorithms defined in {{kem-alg-specs}} and the signature algorithms defined in {{sig-alg-specs}} are a set of new public key algorithms that extend the algorithm selection of {{I-D.ietf-openpgp-crypto-refresh}}.
During the transition period, the post-quantum algorithms will not be supported by all clients.
Therefore various migration considerations must be taken into account, in particular backwards compatibility to existing implementations that have not yet been updated to support the post-quantum algorithms.

## Key preference

Implementations SHOULD prefer PQ(/T) keys when multiple options are available.

For instance, if encrypting for a recipient for which both a valid PQ/T and a valid ECC certificate are available, the implementation SHOULD choose the PQ/T certificate.
In case a certificate has both a PQ/T and an ECC encryption-capable valid subkey, the PQ/T subkey SHOULD be preferred.

An implementation MAY sign with both a PQ(/T) and an ECC key using multiple signatures over the same data as described in {{multiple-signatures}}.
Signing only with PQ(/T) key material is not backwards compatible.

Note that the confidentiality of a message is not post-quantum secure when encrypting to multiple recipients if at least one recipient does not support PQ/T encryption schemes.
An implementation SHOULD NOT abort the encryption process in this case to allow for a smooth transition to post-quantum cryptography.

## Key generation strategies

It is RECOMMENDED to generate fresh secrets when generating PQ(/T) keys.
Note that reusing key material from existing ECC keys in PQ(/T) keys does not provide backwards compatibility.

An OpenPGP certificate is composed of a certification-capable primary key and one or more subkeys for signature, encryption, and authentication.
Two migration strategies are recommended:

1. Generate two independent certificates, one for PQ(/T)-capable implementations, and one for legacy implementations.
   Implementations not understanding PQ(/T) certificates can use the legacy certificate, while PQ(/T)-capable implementations will prefer the newer certificate.
   This allows having an older v4 or v6 certificate for compatibility and a v6 PQ(/T) certificate, at a greater complexity in key distribution.

2. Attach PQ(/T) encryption subkeys to an existing traditional OpenPGP certificate.
   In the case of a v6 certificate, also PQ(/T) signature keys may be attached.
   Implementations understanding PQ(/T) will be able to parse and use the subkeys, while PQ(/T)-incapable implementations can gracefully ignore them.
   This simplifies key distribution, as only one certificate needs to be communicated and verified, but leaves the primary key vulnerable to quantum computer attacks.

# Security Considerations

## Security Aspects of Composite Signatures

When multiple signatures are applied to a message, the question of the protocol's resistance against signature stripping attacks naturally arises.
In a signature stripping attack, an adversary removes one or more of the transmitted signatures such that only a subset of the signatures originally applied by the sender remain in the message that reaches the recipient.
This amounts to a downgrade attack that potentially reduces the value of the signature.
It should be noted that the composite signature schemes specified in this draft are not subject to a signature stripping vulnerability.
This is due to the fact that in any OpenPGP signature, the hashed meta data includes the signature algorithm ID, as specified in {{I-D.ietf-openpgp-crypto-refresh}}, Section 5.2.4.
As a consequence, a component signature taken out of the context of a specific composite algorithm is not a valid signature for any message.

Furthermore, it is also not possible to craft a new signature for a message that was signed twice with a composite algorithm by interchanging (i.e., remixing) the component signatures, which would classify as a weak existential forgery.
This is due to the fact that each v6 signatures also includes a random salt at the start of the hashed meta data, as also specified in the aforementioned reference.

## Hashing in ECDH-KEM

Our construction of the ECDH-KEMs, in particular the inclusion of `ecdhCipherText` in the final hashing step in encapsulation and decapsulation that produces the `ecdhKeyShare`, is standard and known as hashed ElGamal key encapsulation, a hashed variant of ElGamal encryption.
It ensures IND-CCA2 security in the random oracle model under some Diffie-Hellman intractability assumptions [CS03].
The additional inclusion of `ecdhPublicKey` follows the security advice in Section 6.1 of {{RFC7748}}.

## Key combiner {#sec-key-combiner}

For the key combination in {{kem-key-combiner}} this specification limits itself to the use of KMAC.
The sponge construction used by KMAC was proven to be indifferentiable from a random oracle {{BDPA08}}.
This means, that in contrast to SHA2, which uses a Merkle-Damgard construction, no HMAC-based construction is required for key combination.
Except for a domain separation it is sufficient to simply process the concatenation of any number of key shares when using a sponge-based construction like KMAC.
The construction using KMAC ensures a standardized domain separation.
In this case, the processed message is then the concatenation of any number of key shares.

More precisely, for a given capacity `c` the indifferentiability proof shows that assuming there are no weaknesses found in the Keccak permutation, an attacker has to make an expected number of `2^(c/2)` calls to the permutation to tell KMAC from a random oracle.
For a random oracle, a difference in only a single bit gives an unrelated, uniformly random output.
Hence, to be able to distinguish a key `K`, derived from shared keys `K1` and `K2` (and ciphertexts `C1` and `C2`) as

    K = KMAC(domainSeparation, counter || K1 || C1 || K2 || C2 || fixedInfo,
    outputBits, customization)

from a random bit string, an adversary has to know (or correctly guess) both key shares `K1` and `K2`, entirely.

The proposed construction in {{kem-key-combiner}} preserves IND-CCA2 of any of its ingredient KEMs, i.e. the newly formed combined KEM is IND-CCA2 secure as long as at least one of the ingredient KEMs is.
Indeed, the above stated indifferentiability from a random oracle qualifies Keccak as a split-key pseudorandom function as defined in {{GHP18}}.
That is, Keccak behaves like a random function if at least one input shared secret is picked uniformly at random.
Our construction can thus be seen as an instantiation of the IND-CCA2 preserving Example 3 in Figure 1 of {{GHP18}}, up to some reordering of input shared secrets and ciphertexts.
In the random oracle setting, the reordering does not influence the arguments in {{GHP18}}.

## Domain separation and binding {#sec-fixed-info}

The `domSeparation` information defined in {{kem-key-combiner}} provides the domain separation for the key combiner construction.
This ensures that the input keying material is used to generate a KEK for a specific purpose or context.

The `fixedInfo` defined in {{kem-fixed-info}} binds the derived KEK to the chosen algorithm and communication parties.
The algorithm ID identifies unequivocally the algorithm, the parameters for its instantiation, and the length of all artifacts, including the derived key.

This is in line with the Recommendation for ECC in section 5.5 of [SP800-56A].
Other fields included in the recommendation are not relevant for the OpenPGP protocol, since the sender is not required to have a key of their own, there are no pre-shared secrets, and all the other parameters are unequivocally defined by the algorithm ID.

Furthermore, we do not require the recipients public key into the key combiner as the public key material is already included in the component key derivation functions.
Given two KEMs which we assume to be multi-user secure, we combine their outputs using a KEM-combiner:

    K = H(K1, C1, K2, C2), C = (C1, C2)

Our aim is to preserve multi-user security.
A common approach to this is to add the public key into the key derivation for K.
However, it turns out that this is not necessary here.
To break security of the combined scheme in the multi-user setting, the adversary has to distinguish a set of challenge keys

  K*_u = H(K1*_u, C1*_u, K2*_u, C2*_u)

for users u in some set from random, also given ciphertexts `C*_u = (C1*_u, C2*_u)`.
For each of these K* it holds that if the adversary never makes a query

    H(K1*_u, C1*_u, K2*_u, C2*_u)

they have a zero advantage over guessing.

The only multi-user advantage that the adversary could gain therefore consists of queries to H that are meaningful for two different users u1 != u2 and their associated public keys.
This is only the case if

    (c1*_u1, c2*_u1) = (c1*_u2, c2*_u2)

as the ciphertext values decide for which challenge the query is meaningful.
This means that a ciphertext collision is needed between challenges.
Assuming that the randomness used in the generation of the two challenges is uncorrelated, this is negligible.

In consequence, the ciphertexts already work sufficiently well as domain-separator.

## SLH-DSA-SHAKE Message Randomizer {#slhdsa-sec-cons}

The specification of SLH-DSA-SHAKE {{FIPS-205}} prescribes an optional non-deterministic message randomizer.
This is not used in this specification, as OpenPGP v6 signatures already provide a salted signature data digest of the appropriate size.

## Binding hashes in signatures with signature algorithms

In order not to extend the attack surface, we bind the hash algorithm used for signature data digestion to the hash algorithm used internally by the signature algorithm.

ML-DSA internally uses a SHAKE256 digest, therefore we require SHA3 in the ML-DSA + EdDSA signature packet, see {{mldsa-sig-data-digest}}.
Note that we bind a NIST security category 2 hash function to a signature algorithm that falls into NIST security category 3.
This does not constitute a security bottleneck: because of the unpredictable random salt that is prepended to the digested data in v6 signatures, the hardness assumption is not collision resistance but second-preimage resistance.

In the case of SLH-DSA-SHAKE the internal hash algorithm varies based on the algorithm ID, see {{slhdsa-sig-data-digest}}.

## Symmetric Algorithms for SEIPD Packets

This specification mandates support for `AES-256` for two reasons.
First, `AES-KeyWrap` with `AES-256` is already part of the composite KEM construction.
Second, some of the PQ(/T) algorithms target the security level of `AES-256`.

For the same reasons, this specification further recommends the use of `AES-256` if it is supported by all recipients, regardless of what the implementation would otherwise choose based on the recipients' preferences.
This recommendation should be understood as a clear and simple rule for the selection of `AES-256` for encryption.
Implementations may also make more nuanced decisions.

# Additional considerations

## Performance Considerations for SLH-DSA-SHAKE {#performance-considerations}

This specification introduces both ML-DSA + EdDSA as well as SLH-DSA-SHAKE as PQ(/T) signature schemes.

Generally, it can be said that ML-DSA + EdDSA provides a performance in terms of execution time requirements that is close to that of traditional ECC signature schemes.
Regarding the size of signatures and public keys, though, ML-DSA has far greater requirements than traditional schemes like EC-based or even RSA signature schemes.

Implementers may want to offer SLH-DSA-SHAKE for applications where the weaker security assumptions of a hash-based signature scheme are required – namely only the 2nd preimage resistance of a hash function – and thus a potentially higher degree of trust in the long-term security of signatures is achieved.
However, SLH-DSA-SHAKE has performance characteristics in terms of execution time of the signature generation as well as space requirements for the signature that are even greater than those of ML-DSA + EdDSA signature schemes.

Pertaining to the execution time, the particularly costly operation in SLH-DSA-SHAKE is the signature generation.
Depending on the parameter set, it can range from approximately the one hundred fold to more than the two thousand fold of that of ML-DSA-87.
These number are based on the performance measurements published in the NIST submissions for SLH-DSA-SHAKE and ML-DSA.
In order to achieve fast signature generation times, the algorithm SLH-DSA-SHAKE-128f ("f" standing for "fast") should be chosen.
This comes at the expense of a larger signature size.
This choice can be relevant in applications where mass signing occurs or a small latency is required.

In order to minimize the space requirements of an SLH-DSA-SHAKE signature, an algorithm ID with the name ending in "s" for "small" should be chosen.
This comes at the expense of a longer signature generation time.
In particular, SLH-DSA-SHAKE-128s achieves the smallest possible signature size, which is about the double size of an ML-DSA-87 signature.
Where a higher security level than 128 bit is needed, SLH-DSA-SHAKE-256s can be used.

Unlike the signature generation time, the signature verification time of SLH-DSA-SHAKE is not that much larger than that of other PQC schemes.
Based on the performance measurements published in the NIST submissions for SLH-DSA-SHAKE and ML-DSA, the verification time of the SLH-DSA-SHAKE is, for the parameters covered by this specification, larger than that of ML-DSA-87 by a factor ranging from four (for -128s) over nine (for -256s) to twelve (for -128f).

# IANA Considerations

IANA is requested to add the algorithm IDs defined in {{iana-pubkey-algos}} to the existing registry `OpenPGP Public Key Algorithms`.
The field specifications enclosed in brackets for the ML-KEM + ECDH composite algorithms denote fields that are only conditionally contained in the data structure.
